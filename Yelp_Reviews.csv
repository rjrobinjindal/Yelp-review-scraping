J Wata Temaki Bar	S L.	Went again recently with a friend.  Wow just as amazing as last time. Waiter was on point! Fast, friendly and even let us know about the happy hour ending soon. We ordered about $70 worth of food/drink and had a really good time.  Pleas be advised that good sushi takes time, there is one chef and each roll is made by hand. When there is a full house, it may take awhile to receive your orders.  Chef was awesome, very friendly and everything tasted fresh and wonderful.  Wagyu: A MUST! So tender and amazingly flavorful.  Salmon: good but tuna was better.  Negi Toro (tuna belly): I usually don't like tuna rolls, but this was really good!  Salmon skin: nice and crunchy. Not my thing, but friend liked it.  Shrimp tempura roll: good, nice kick.  Spicy tempura app: A MUST! I could just eat bowls of this. So good. Shrimp were big and plump. Sauce was spicy and really good.  Unagi (Eel) roll: really good, nice big piece of eel. Highly recommend.  Sweet sake was good but very strong almost 15% alcohol. Pretty big bottle for one person, $11.  Parking is really tough in this lot. I recommend parking at the Jasmine lot and paying $2 for two hours of parking. Very short walk across the street and beats the stress of finding parking.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Stephanie W.	Overall: 3.5 stars  Food: great Ambiance: great Service: good  Ordered the \"Go\" set menu and really loved the Negi salmon and the Hamachi golden-ratio tare the most. The quality of the fish on those two were amazing. The others were good but these two truly shined.  Typically, I usually am a huge fan of nigiri so this style is much different since they only serve hand rolls. This consists of mostly rice which is incredibly filling. For the price, I do feel like I'd rather go somewhere I could get more bang for my buck. As far as service, the bar is manned by one chef who bounces back and forth between the different parties and serves them a few hand rolls at a time. A server also helps out by getting drink orders and also any food from the kitchen. This also leads to getting super full fast since there is a lot of down time in between hand rolls. Overall, this place is great and very different from other places in the area. However, I can't really see myself coming back again.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Melissa B.	I do like the smaller sized restaurant and at bar seating as well as the focus on hand rolls, but nothing excited me enough to want a second trip. We arrived at happy hour and enjoyed discounts on rolls and rock shrimp. The rock shrimp portions were very small and similar dishes I've had toss the shrimp in the sauce for more coverage, which I prefer. These were tasty but lacking sauce. The crunchy exterior of the roll is nice, right off of the heating element they use when making them.   Service was underwhelming. The hard wood chairs with no padding or comfort had me squirming and eager to leave. I had hoped to enjoy myself more, but this was a one hit wonder for me.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Anthony E.	This place was cool!  I thought I was going to meet J Wata the man, the myth, the legend since his business photos were shown here on Yelp but one can only imagine, right?  Instead, we were hosted by a couple of cool Chefs working that night which we had great conversations with and giving us a little introduction of each dish we were about to partake on.  The restaurant is decorated with familiar Anime drawings from past movie cult classics if you're into that sort of thing.  The food was delicious and goes great with some of their premium cold sake collection too.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Brittany R.	Over due review. My apologies! 8/18.  I made reservations here specifically because my girlfriend and I LOVE sugar fish. But due to the fact we live in San Diego and it's a crazy drive I wanted to find something a bit similar but more convenient. Thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem.   I made lunch reservations here for my gfs early birthday and I'm so glad I did. It's located in the busy plaza where RakiRaki, Tofu house, Crab hut \u0026 Tapioca express are smashed so closely together.   PARKING: It's always a b*tch finding a spot that can accommodate your car (spots are super small \u0026 cramped) or it's just traffic jam central fighting for a spot lmao. But, magically we got lucky.   DECOR/AMBIENCE/CLEANLINESS: It's small, but I think that's the point of it all. Reservations, close knit, personal service. The walls are covered with anime-esque drawings and modernize accents. Very pretty! The bathrooms were very clean and had all refilled supplies. Great job!   THE FOOD: You order your Temaki for ONE person, ONE at a time. It's best eaten fresh because the Nori is hand roasted in front of you and the rice is a bit warm. I personally like the time intervals in between bites, makes you appreciate each piece of food individually. Happy hour starts from 3-5pm as well.   HH Premium Wagyu Shabu Temaki (ordered x2) Unfortunately it's 1 per person during HH but these were super yummy. The crunchy nori set me over the top! Delicious. I'm happy we started off with these.   HH Negi Toro Temaki (ordered x2) These had to be my absolute favorite out of them all. The toro was fresh and not fishy. Butter melt in your mouth feels. Im probably going to keep talking about the roasted nori....it just adds a little somethin special with each bite. *miss it already D: *  THE \"GO\" Temaki (ordered x2, not allowed to share) Instead of ordering \u00c0 la carte, you can order a set menu (it's cheaper in some ways) and helpful if you need assistance in ordering.   Negi Salmon: Fresh \u0026 Buttery, not fishy!  Spicy Tuna: Just the right amount of spicy to tuna ratio. Easily eaten! (Our server also gave us and extra one! Thank you!)   Hamachi Golden Tare:  Not my favorite, but the fish was very smooth going down. My girlfriend really liked this one.   Bay Scallop:  I think it also had some fish roe mixed in, so it had a soft yet crunchy texture. Mayo was also added and it was a bit too much for me. My gf made me finish hers smh.  Maine Lobster:  Delicious, not too much of a sauce or seasoning on this because they really want you to taste the seafood. It wasn't dried out, perfectly cooked and balanced out with the warm rice.   SERVICE:  I'm really horrendous with remembering names, but we had a guy serve/prepare our rolls. He was very attentive, friendly and made good conversation.   I roughly spent less than $55, and overall I think the food, price and service was worth it. My girlfriend and I were very satisfied. I recommend coming during lunch/HH because you'll beat the dinner rush in the plaza, also come HUNGRY! You'll be eating a lot of rice :)	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Anna B.	It's a temaki/hand roll restaurant and the chefs just hand you each temaki one by one! I went for happy hour from 3-5pm over the weekend and there were amazing deals with a great variety. All the seating is high tables surrounding where the chefs make the food so it is really fun watching most of the food get made.   Alberto was the main chef making our rolls and he was extremely personable. He kept up a fun conversation with us, and really made us enjoy our meal. Paola was a fabulous waitress as well, she was very attentive and always made sure our orders were sent in when needed.   The restaurant is clean, there is fun music being played that isn't too loud, beautiful artwork surrounding the walls, and delicious food. The menu is obviously larger during regular lunch and dinner hours so I am excited to check it out then!   Parking is pretty packed because of all of the popular business, so be open to using street parking if necessary.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jenn C.	Another solid Japanese restaurant on Convoy! We dropped by today with reservations via Yelp. It was pretty crowded around 6 pm. The restaurant is small and not great for groups larger than three, but because it's all counter-style seating a group larger than that wouldn't be able to easily chat with each other anyway. We ordered the \"Go\" set of five hand rolls - salmon, lobster, scallop, yellowtail, and tuna for $21. We agreed that the salmon, lobster, and scallop were best and weren't fans of the other two. Next time I'll order a la carte.  Minus one star because of spotty service and because it's located in that one shopping plaza with the worst (IMO) parking (the one with Crab Hut and TapEx).  For parents, they do have high chairs but because the counters are so tall the baby would be much lower than you'd want.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Martha W.	I came here again because my husband really likes it. He likes the toasted seaweed for the rolls. Myself I am not a fan of seaweed, so I ordered the popcorn shrimp appetizer. It seemed like the guy practically threw it at me when he placed it on the ledge. It felt unfriendly to me. I dunno maybe I am just in a bad mood.?Still not going to increase the rating.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Conner S.	Came in here for happy hour the other day and I was thoroughly impressed! Sushi isn't the cheapest of meals, so I think their food is fairly priced on the regular menu - but the happy hour was a BARGAIN! They had temaki handrolls from $2-$4 and beers were $1.99! My girlfriend and I came here, we ate a ton and we only spent like $40 including tip!  Now it's one thing to get a good deal - but is the quality and selection worth it? Absolutely! I primarily stuck with the negi-toro (minced tuna) and negi-salmon (minced salmon) but we did order a few others as well and they were all delicious. The rolls are served one by one, and you take them directly from the sushi chef's hand and right into your mouth.   To add to our great experience, the service was top notch! Since the restaurant was a little quieter while we were there, we got to engage in conversation with our sushi chef and that just added to our five star experience.  Give this place a shot!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Anna L.	I am a fan of J Wata Temaki Bar!  I was here for dinner one night and came back the next day for lunch with some coworkers.  When empty, the overall experience was wonderful.  We got a chance to talk to the chef and inquire more about the rolls.  When busy, it's a little tougher.  The place is small, and like any place, it can be understaffed sometimes.  We waited 30+ minutes for our check so that was a little rough.  Onto the good -- the hand rolls!  They have predefined sets for lunch and dinner.  During lunch, there are some lunch specials which are nice.  I need 3 hand rolls to feel full, and it is nice to try the different ones available.  My favorites are the blue crab, salmon, and some of the vegetarian rolls.  If you're ordering anything to go, I do recommend just placing the order at the beginning of your meal depending on how busy the restaurant is.    While there, I noticed that there were many people who did not remember what they ordered.  Or the chef makes a handroll and hands it to someone, and they're like \"I didn't order this.\"  There seems to be a need for a system to keep track of the rolls where both the customer and chef know exactly what is meant to be made.  I would hate to see rolls wasted just because it wasn't something someone ordered or wanted.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kaylah M.	This place is absolutely amazing. The fish is just so fresh. Quality is hard to find ok convoy when it comes to sushi. The temaki style is great! It allows you to try so many different items before you get full.   This place is a must try	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Money S.	This was my first time at a temaki bar and I really enjoyed it!  We had a group of 5 and we were lucky one side of the restaurant was empty when we arrived (bar style seating).   We each ordered the Go (5) Temaki and a few other items.  Each hand roll was delicious but I especially loved the Spicy tuna, Bay scallop, and Maine lobster. The meal started out with some hot and delicious miso soup, it's probably the tastiest miso soup I've had. I also ordered iced green tea, which wasn't very strong and didn't have enough ice either. It tasted like slightly cold water with a hint of green tea...  I love how the rolls come out one at a time so you always have something to look forward to, without having a bunch food sitting in front of you.  There were only two cons during our visit. The first was the bathroom sink wasn't working so we had to walk next door to Tapioca Express to wash our hands.   The second was that some in our group ordered some happy hour items (it was about 10 mins before happy hour started). The items didn't come out until well after happy hour started, but when the bill came they wouldn't honor the happy hour prices. We understood that they ordered before happy hour (only 10 minutes), but we thought it would've been nice if they had honored the happy hour price. It's not like we ordered only HH items. We ordered several items on the regular menu and two bottles of sake as well. It was only a few bucks difference, but that's the type of thing that leaves a bad impression.   Besides those two hiccups, we had a great lunch.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Christine L.	This was my first time eating at this establishment, and I was very excited to try it as I am a huge sushi fanatic. The food did not disappoint! Me and my hubby ordered both the shi and go set menu.   Our favorites of the night were the negi yellowtail, hamachi golden ratio, bay scallop, and maine lobster. Everything was so fresh and mouth watering, I would say the blue crab and bay scallop had a touch too much mayonnaise but besides that, superb.    The service was also wonderful. The waitress was attentive and the sushi chef was friendly and funny. The GM Philip was also very kind and accommodating over the phone.  Our overall experience was amazing, and it made my birthday celebration wonderful. We are looking forward to dining at J/wata again(:	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Valerie M.	Wow, toasted seaweed handrolls that are traditional (small) that you eat as handed to you. They also have sashimi. Fresh scallops, and fish. They have different options of how many you can order, like 4 HR's , they serve you miso soup too. Ask for little rice. Makes a huge difference. They also have sakes. The center this place is in has a small parking lot and always extremely hard to park in but the place is fantastic. Must try.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jessica D.	What I ordered: lunch special with one non premium (Negi salmon) handroll + a wagyu handroll + miso soup + salad ($10.95)  Taste: portion was good for lunch, the two dishes I got didn't really have sauce so if you like a simple flavor of the fish/meat this is good for you   Service: great service, very friendly  Parking: small lot (really hard lot to park in) park in street	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kristine D.	I love this place! Their hand rolls are delicious and made right in front of you. It's a pretty small spot so if you know ahead of time that you wanna eat here, I definitely suggest that you make a reservation. It's inside the business area of Tapioca Express, RakiRaki, and O'Briens. It's a VERY busy and tiny parking lot.   Here, you can order a set of 3, 4, and 5 temaki (hand rolls) and it's a set menu. They're small but filling, and you're not allowed to share. But why would you wanna share it's so gooood. They have vegetarian options, and a la carte as well. My bf and I both ordered 4 hand rolls, and some off the a la carte menu. The nori is toasted, and hand rolls are made right in front of you. The fish tasted really fresh, my bf had the wagyu and said it was delicioussss  Staff here is really nice. They try to pay attention and interact with each customer. It's basically one big table with the chefs inside, and the seats are formed in a U shape. The art on the wall is pretty neat too! I definitely would come back again	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Joyce C.	I've been here quite a few times, so it's about time I left some positive feedback. Prior to coming here, I wasn't the biggest fan of hand rolls, so I'm not really sure what possessed me to try this place out to be honest. Either way, it was a great decision and now I love hand rolls as long as they're made here.   These hand rolls are cylindrical, instead of the traditional conical shape. This allows you to eat the filling, rice, and nori at the same time instead of being left with just rice towards the end. Also, the rolls are made one by one so they don't get cold or soggy. I've had the dinner sets a couple times - I usually get set 4 or 5. Both are very good, depending if you want 4 or 5 hand rolls. They now have lunch specials too - house salad, miso soup, and 2 hand rolls. A la carte is always an option too. James has been our sushi chef the last couple times. Not only does he make a good roll, but he's funny and is also a great conversationalist.  Overall, super happy that I got to try this place out. It isn't in the best lot on Convoy, but it doesn't deter me. Try this place out if you haven't already!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sharon L.	I would give this place 3.5 stars. The service was great. The food was ok. Kazunori in LA is way better. I came for happy hour and spent close to $30. The best rolls are the scallop and salmon skin. I tried the happy hour rolls (salmon, toro, salmon skin, spicy tuna, scallop), popocorn shrimp, and salmon sashimi.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tatyana T.	Best San Diego hand roll experience, period! Pair your favorites with a good bottle of nigori and a close company of friends.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tina S.	First time eating at a Temaki bar. Came here after a late lunch so mainly here to feed my eyes and camera.   They have preset combos or you can choose your own. I tried the Negi Toro, Maine Lobster, and Uni with Shisho. Would skip the Shisho in the uni with shisho. Even though shisho tastes good, I felt that it overpowered the uni. Definitely enjoyed the crispy seaweed experience. Can't really tell how fresh the toppings were but I can tell that it wasn't bad.   Price is fair. The staff was tentative. Chef was awesome and accommodating. Glad we were able to squeeze this meal into our trip.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sarah C.	Awesome little Temaki spot!! My husband and I came here today (Saturday) and had a reservation at 7:15p. We came early but were able to be seated right away as it wasn't super busy. Atmosphere was great! I liked how the seating was set up in a U-shape so that the chefs serve each temaki directly to you. They have to be eaten right away in order for the seaweed to stay crisp. The menu is small but they also have specials written on their board inside the restaurant. We decided to order a la carte and ordered 5 rolls each. My husband ordered monkey balls as well.  I got the hamachi golden-ratio, bay scallop, negi toro, blue crab, and uni. All of my rolls were delicious and had nice, toasted seaweed! I do think my Uni, however, didn't taste as sweet as I'd like. It had a more bitter taste. I did like how our chef didn't actually add the shiso leaf, which I think it standardly come with. It probably would've overpowered the uni. My favorites of the rolls were the hamachi and the blue crab. Yum!  My husband ordered negi salmon, negi yellowtail, negi toro, salmon skin, and Maine lobster. After he took a bite of each roll, he would look at me and smile with approval, haha.   The monkey balls did take a little while to come out. Our chef gave my husband a hamachi roll during our wait. Not sure if it was by mistake but my husband took it anyway and said it was delicious! I looked at the receipt after our meal and we weren't charged for the extra hamachi roll. Score! Oh, the monkey balls were yummy by the way. It's like a deep fried sushi. It came with 4 half pieces and you gotta be careful eating them cuz they were hot. Give them a little time to cool before chomping down on those balls.   Our chef was awesome, servers were nice but could use a little more training because we were kinda lost in the beginning with who was actually our server, what to do with our paper, and had to ask for water refills when our cup was completely empty. I rate it 4.5 stars and rounded up to 5 for our great chef and delicious food!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sam S.	Located in convoy, right next to Crab Hut.....so obviously, the parking SUCKS, BUT....the sushi is really good. Made to order right in front of you. Something about their rice and seaweed, it makes the sushi!!!! The warm ness of the seaweed in every bite you take is delicious. The spicy salmon is my favorite so far, but honestly, they're all good!! The service can be a wait though.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Vincent T.	TL;DR - Very good, but expect to pay for it. It's pretty good quality fish and so the price reflects the quality and experience.  I got the five-set and have had it a few times now, taste is very consistent throughout all visits.  1 - Salmon  By far the best one, 10/10 would definitely just order 5x of these and be happy.  2 - Lobster It's alright, it's claw meat so it's so so.  3 - Spicy Tuna Honestly I don't really like spicy tuna ever, so I just chug this one down with water and soy sauce  4 - Hamachi Very interesting fish and comes with greens inside. Very unique and I enjoy it.  5 - Scallops Once again, kind of an odd mix, but still very delicious.  Overall, this place is great :) and deserves the five stars for great atmosphere and food!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jenny T.	I came here with a group for a little snack because we were waiting for another reservation but got too hungry during the wait.  The counter is set up in that U formation so everyone is sitting in a single line next to each other.   This place only does hand rolls.  What's nice about it is that they make the hand rolls fresh and in front of you, and then hand it right over to you, so you're getting it right when it's made.  They lightly toast the nori with a small flame, so it's slightly warm when you bite into it.  It also comes out pretty quickly.    I ordered the Bay Scallop Hand Roll ($5).  Definitely small for $5, there's no way you could get full off of just one.  But for this visit it was fine because we only wanted a small snack.  I don't recommend this place if you don't like mayo, because a lot of the hand rolls on the menu contain mayo in them.   This is definitely not a place for you to just hang out and chat with your friends.  They try to get you in and out as quickly as possible, even if you're the only group in there.  I wouldn't recommend coming here for a complete meal, because you're not going to get full from here.  This place is best to go to if you're not that hungry to begin with, or if you want a small snack.  It's also pretty pricey for the size that it is, but I'm sure it goes to the quality of the ingredients.  You also can't split their set menu which is a bummer.  The hand rolls that we tried were pretty good, so it was a pleasant experience for my first hand roll place.  Just note that it's not a sit down and loiter kind of place.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Trish S.	Sushi isn't hard to find in San Diego, but unique sushi is more of a challenge! This spot has been on my radar for awhile and it ended up being my first night out since the birth of my daughter.   A girlfriend met me here and we sat at the bar. It was a weeknight at 630 but I had a reservation regardless - it's a tiny place! We order drinks and some delicious and super garlicky edamame to start. It was the tail end of happy hour so we got some discount on our order.   Temaki is aka hand rolls, and if done well can be a really true expression of what sushi is really all about: the high quality fish, perfect rice and seaweed of course! We really enjoyed everything we had here and the staff was attentive and Chef CHEF JUNYA WATANABE was delighted to create.  Note that each roll is made to order so settle in for a bit and try the yellowtail! It was my favorite of the night.   Parking in this shopping center is the worst. You've been warned.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jimmy D.	3.5 Stars  Cool concept as you can easily drop in for a handroll or few.  Rolls came out fairly quick after ordering and they only make one at a time for you so that it is eaten fresh.  The rice is fairly warm and the nori was lightly toasted for a slight crisp on the first few bites.  The raw seafood was fresh and prepared well.  I got the \"Go\" premium set.  I felt that there could have been more protein than rice.  There was also more mayo than I wanted in some of the handrolls.  Blue Crab - Sweet crab flavor, mixed with mayo Spicy Toro - fatty and not as spicy as expected.    Negi Salmon - good flavors and nice texture. Probably my favorite Bay Scallop - I love scallops but this had way too much mayo Maine Lobster - Good tasting lobster with just enough mayo in it.  Overall - this is a great snack.  5 rolls wasn't enough to fill me up, but I didn't want more either.  Getting the set is a better value but i'd like to skip all the rolls with mayo, which seem to be a lot of them.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Yueming Q.	I'm so happy to check out this place. It is a very small restaurant which is a little difficult to find because it doesn't have obvious name mark on the door. But once you walk in, you will love this bar style restaurant. You can get very close to chef, watching them make beautiful and delicious hand rolls. This restaurant's price is very reasonable, especially if you come here at happy hour, you can totally enjoy a full nice meal in very good price! I highly recommend.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lili T.	J WATA!!! I've never been to a restaurant and experienced this type of dining experience before and I really enjoyed it! I can't lie - I took advantage of the BOGO Grand Opening deal!  I went once with my friend's deal and we got the Go which included 5 handrolls per person - Maine Lobster, Spicy Tuna, Negi Salmon, Scallops, and Blue Crab. It was so delicious, I went again the next day with my little brother! I love that each handroll is made right in front of us and the seaweed is roasted over the open flame. They tell us to be sure to try and eat it quickly so that we can experience the crunch of the nori - YUM is all I can say! Having that crunch of the nori is the added bonus to a well crafted roll!   Ranking the rolls from my most favorite to least favorite: Maine Lobster, Negi Salmon, Spicy Tuna and Blue Crab tied, and scallops. I don't absolutely LOVE the scallops with mayo which is why I ranked it as my least favorite. All rolls are crafted with hot rice and rolled like a burrito style rather than a cone.   Our service was top notch and I'm excited to come back here when I'm back in town - however, it is kind of pricey without the deal!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Theresa N.	Hubby and I were so excited to check out this place last weekend, we got there 45 minutes before opening to get in line, lol.  I can officially say that was probably not necessary, as other people didn't actually show up until maybe 15-20 minutes prior.  Alas however, our over-achievement paid off!  Seating in this place is limited.  Maybe about 15-20 people inside at a time I think.  You get seated around where all the action is and they make your temaki right there!  You can order the temaki by sets, or a la carte.  We decided to go with Set Go (5), which includes:  Maine lobster, blue crab. spicy toro, negi salmon and bay scallop.  Also ordered the hamachi sashimi as well as the uni ikura temaki.  Let me tell you, eat the roll as soon as they hand it to you.  They are tasty and fresh as hell.  Like, complete melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  Everything in the ingredients, down to the rice, is perfection.   Also, they use premium soy sauce, which is superb with the rolls.  You'll wonder why you never ate them like this before!  I joked with the hubby and said I could eat this everyday.  I haven't, but have been several times this past week =P.  Take all my money already, Junya!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jasmine C.	I love that convoy is opening all these new restaurants. J wata sells premium hand rolls. Their menu is set and they will not adjust unless you have allergies.   Tbh, this is my first hand roll experience so I don't have anything to compare it to but it was good! My friend and I signed up for their grand opening BOGO special through Facebook. It's happening the weekend of 7/13-7/15 and 7/20-7/22.   The interior of the place is simple and I really liked the art of the wall. There's limited seatings so the wait can take some time. Each hand roll is made fresh and the chefs don't make the next one until you're done with the one in front of you. It's best to eat it quickly or the seaweed will soften and makes it harder to bite   I ordered the \"GO\" which is 5 hand rolls.  Spicy tuna - fresh Negi salmon - one of my favorite. It was simple. Can't go wrong with salmon.  Maine lobster - fresh but had a lot of mayo  Blue crab - also fresh and covered in mayo  Bay scallop - probably the best one. It was light, fresh, and nicely coated in a sauce.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Desmond F.	4.5 stars  A premium hand roll experience, everything is made fresh and just before you eat it. One can get rolls a la carte or there are there are set menus San (3) Shi (4) and Go (5) and if you're not picky is the way to go to get the price breaks. We ordered two Go sets and a few a la cart to try everything we wanted. In the end we tried the Maine Lobster, Bay Scallop, Spicy toro, Negi Salmon, Blue Crab, Shabu Wagyu Beef and Unagi.  Everything was very good, what stood out to me was the smoky crunchiness of the nori. It starts out lovingly flame kissed and then only when it is warmed and toasted is it used.  Most places the nori is a mass produced after thought, there just for the structural integrity of the roll or handroll. But here it is your introduction, the beautiful edible wrapping paper of a tasty gift to your palate.   Of the 7 rolls I had the opportunity to try the blue crab was the one that stood out to me. After the first bite the flavor hit me as a reminder of how a premium Japanese taste experience is really just a moment of simple yet eye opening tranquility. It was just a fleeting few bites but so awakening.   J/Wata is not for all, the wait will invariably be long because of the limited seating (I counted about 20) so a large party will not do well here. It is also located in the my least favorite part of Convoy, the Parking lot from hell. Even with the set menus it is expensive for the amount of food your are getting. Perhaps not the most effective price point is reached here but transcendence comes at a cost and I'm glad there exists those who reach for that, even for a few bites.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ryan C.	J Wata is going to be added to my very short list of restaurants I'll be a regular at.    They have a very fresh take on Temaki and rather than create a \"cone\" they roll it like a \"tiny burrito\" so you get the same consistency of ingredients in every bite.  It's smartly done.   I ordered the five-piece meal which includes hamachi and scallops and every single bite was heaven.  The seafood was incredibly fresh and it was wrapped in warm, crispy nori that had been cooked over a Shichirin Grill--the same time of grill Ariana Grande had tattooed on her hand (lol)...Which as an aside, is still something I'm extremely amused by.    Lastly, their hot green tea is the best I've had.  It's thick and full of tiny green tea flakes floating in the mixture.  It is hands down better than the tea I've had at nearly every other Japanese restaurant.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lucy K.	J Wata resembles KazuNori in LA with its menu options and quality of handrolls. You can order their set menu or ala carte. Happy hour is such a great deal too! Really good handrolls for super cheap - who can pass on that? I'm surprised this place isn't always packed. There's never a wait here, which is a plus, and service is always great. Parking is the worse, however, so try to find street parking if you can.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jocy C.	4.5 Stars!!  This is my first time at a Temaki Bar (specializing in hand rolls)!  J Wata Temaki Bar is currently in soft opening (as of June 2018).  The creator is Junya Watanabe (also the creator of RakiRaki Ramen and Pokirrito Poke).  We tried the following: - Salmon Sashimi - Steamed Edamame - San Temaki (Blue Crab, Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon) - Bay Scallop Standard Roll - Maine Lobster Premium Roll - Negi Toro Premium Roll - Ikura Premium Roll - Uni Ikura Premium Roll - Ozeki Nigori Sake  Loved the food and freshness overall.   #NOMNOMNOM	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Nick W.	This review is based on the promotion they had when they had their grand opening for BOGO. after just having gone to Kazunori, I didn't want to compare the two but each provide different experiences and it was hard not to.   I think that overall J Wata has a lot to offer and their hand rolls are very good.   Just like Kazunori, this place has a long wait even with the reservation to save a spot. After already having difficult finding a parking spot, we finally got to waiting around for another 30 minutes.   Once walking in, the ambiance is way different from Kazunori since it was more lit.  The room felt more welcoming and had really awesome art on the walls. So we decided to order the Go set selection of rolls and I also got the Uni Ikura.   I have to say that I actually enjoyed the nori here more than the nori from Kazunori, however my girlfriend felt that here the nori stuck to the top of her mouth more.  I decided not to take pictures because I wanted to immerse myself in the experience.   The roll I remember the best and would definitely order again would have to be blue crab. To me it seemed like it was the perfect amount of crab within the nori and that it tasted the best to me. The presentation order of the rolls seemed different to me, but that's according to the chefs and so I can say that it was great to have the contrasting tastes. I also enjoyed the bay scallops roll and the spicy tuna.   I would definitely recommend going here to try it out, there's so much it has to offer and they do offer other rolls and some sashimi! Just hope you can find parking!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jiaxin G.	I got the weekend one grand opening BOGO special so  we used it for our lunch on Sunday afternoon. We got there around 1:50 and there's a line of about 10 people waiting already. It's not too bad even though we waited a little more than half an hour cause we were able to get some boba tea while we waited.   The restaurant have only about 22 seats but the turn over was decent. There were two chiefs making hand rolls for everyone. I feel like this temaki bar is not so much for hanging out. It just doesn't feel right to keep the seats for a long time while there's a line waiting outside the restaurant.  Anyways, we got the \"Go\" hand roll set (~$22 at regular price for 5 hand rolls). It came with spicy tuna hand roll, scallop hand roll, Maine lobster hand roll, blue crab hand roll and salmon hand roll. The shape of the hand rolls was not what you normally see in other sushi restaurant. The fillings sat in the middle of the hand roll and the two ends had a little hollow space. I didn't like this shape cause I couldn't dip the rice in the soy sauce dish.   Our favorite was the spicy tuna hand roll. It's got the right amount of spicy and the tuna didn't have the metal taste. It tasted fresh. My second favorite was the scallop one. Although it had mayonnaise, I still tasted the sweet flavor in the scallop. The Maine lobster and the blue crab hand rolls both had too much mayonnaise. And the salmon hand roll tasted interesting with the scallions.   For some reason the wasabi we had was not spicy at all. We like how wasabi normally get so spicy the taste go up your nose. However, we put chunks of wasabi in our hand rolls but it's only very mildly spicy.   The service was good. The interior design was cool! I like the wall painting very much. However, due to the open front door, fly get in and the inside of the restaurant could be a little warm. If you mind a fly hanging around while you eat, I suggest you don't come here (see my picture).   I am glad we got the BOGO deal to try this restaurant out. Otherwise I would rather spent couple bucks more to get AYCE.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Robert J.	Looked good.  Sounded good.  Was planning on enjoying it with my group.  Made a reservation.  Showed up and was told \"We just sat everyone recently so I am sorry but it will probably be about an hour wait.\"  Um, excuse me?  What is the point of making a reservation if you don't actually hold seats?  You had my number - before sitting the walk in's how about a phone call to confirm?  Their excuse?  \"It got really busy before you walked in.\"  Yeah - that's why I made a reservation!  Customer lost.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Charles M.	Why doesn't this place get more traffic? An underrated gem in the middle of a busy mall.   Came for a Saturday night dinner and there were only four others in the restaurant.   The hand roll style here is interesring - every meal plays out at a slow and steady pace, roll by roll. I ordered the 'Go' from the menu and was very happy. You can watch as every roll is made before your eyes. Be warned, it's a slower pace and may not be for everyone. I liked it though.  The rolls themselves are delicious. They toast the nori on the outside so every roll you get is fresh and warm. And oh, the fish! Their fish is wonderfully fresh.  One gripe though: even with so few people in the restaurant, the waiter service was very poor! Waters were not filled, we were generally not checked up upon.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Joshua F.	First impression on the location, very hard to find parking considering the fact that there are many food places to eat here. The sushi bar is decent sized, kid friendly.  I made reservations fearing that it may be busy, but to my surprise it wasn't as we saw many walk-ins getting seated right away. Our host/hostess was very good at providing quick service, from getting our seats and refilling water and taking our orders from the menu. We did notice one sushi chef taking care of us, as well as many others, maybe too much for one person to handle, sushi here is made one at a time and follows the order they receive it in. I noticed some people waiting longer than usual to get their grub on and it might just make some people restless and hungry waiting for their turn. In my opinion they could've used one more chef for providing faster service.  Anyways the food part, my wife and I ordered the \"shi\" combo each. It consists of 4 different pre-set rolls. The sushi is given to you one at a time. (Side note, chef gave me a sushi roll that I didn't order and I got it free of charge! Lol) All I can say was the sushi is fresh and delicious. The one thing I liked about it was they toast the Nori (seaweed) on an open flame which gives it a smoky flavor and crunchy texture with each bite. I'd recommend going to this sushi spot if you want something for a change.  This has been my own opinion about this place, I encourage you to open your mind and try it for yourself.  From your friendly neighborhood spider- oh wait yelper! Itadakimasu!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Dung N.	It was a spontaneous Friday night and we decided to do our last pit stop here to check out their soft opening phase. My friends ordered the \"San\" and \"Go\" set menu. Set menu items can not be shared or substituted.  I was just finishing my dessert as we walked in here, so I wasn't too hungry, but couldn't resist ordering something, so I got a roll. I decided on the wagyu shabu premium temaki hand roll. They roast every seaweed paper on this cute little open flamed rock, so it has a really nice flavor. Then, for my particular roll, the meat is cooked in broth- shabu style, and then the rice is added and rolled together.   It was one of the tastiest hand roll I have ever had! My friends also enjoyed everything they got as well. Service was also fast and friendly. We were able to chat with the owner for a bit. I will definitely come back with a bigger appetite and try one of their set menus next time.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jonathan P.	I dig this place. I came in right as they opened at 12:30 so it wasn't too busy.  I ordered the Go Set and an extra Negi Toro Roll. Everything was hand-made in front of you and extremely delicious.   I did receive an extra roll towards the end which I'm not sure if it was complimentary or if I received someone else's by mistake. Either way I wasn't charged extra. I'd hope that in the future they have some sort of system to prevent something like this from happening (like a list they can cross off) or clarify that you are receiving an extra roll on the house.  I'd recommend coming to this place for a quick bite with a friend or two.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Saleen D.	If you love hand rolls, J Wata Temaki Bar is your place!  This is owned by the same owners as RakiRaki \u0026 it is just a few doors down from it.  Very busy parking lot!  Save your car from getting a ding by parking on the street!  Very friendly \u0026 attentive customer service!  I love the restaurant's style: a large, hollow square table with the chefs in the middle, seating around the perimeter, \u0026 beautiful art on the walls.  On top of that, the hand rolls are phenomenal!  I came hungry \u0026 tried the following.  All were superb, with my favorites being the Blue Crab, Spicy Salmon, Spicy Toro.  Negi Salmon Spicy Salmon Blue Crab Spicy Toro Unagi Wagyu Shabu	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Elizabete S.	One of the best sushi places I've been in a very long time. Very friendly staff, insanely fresh fish, absolutely delicious.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tiffany T.	Neat concept. The \"Go\" ($27) and \"Shi\" ($22) sets were delicious. Good seafood. Favorites were the blue crab, negi salmon and negi yellowtail and bay scallop. The sushi rice is really good.  Most of their rolls are gluten free, and they have gluten free soy sauce.   The portions are good for lunch. It's an expensive lunch though. Since each sushi chef manages 11 seats, the pace/service could be a little slow as you wait for your next roll. My fianc\u00e9 and I got two sets and dined for a little over an hour.   I did find a hair in my rice that fell out. (If my rice didn't fall out, I wouldn't have known.) A little gross but I got it replaced immediately. Accidents happen...	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ashley D.	I was ecstatic to see a hand roll place pop up in SD as I have been wanting to try Kazunori in LA but have never gotten the chance to. This small store is opened by the owner of Pokerito and Raki Raki, so you can bet its located right in the same plaza.   A friend and I came at 11 before grand opening and we were the only party eating except one other party. We went with the Shi ($16.95) that came with 4 handrolls. Each one was prepared right in front of us. It was fascinating watching the chef crisp up the nori over the fire and roll each hand roll carefully. You really do have to eat each one fast as if not, the seaweed gets soggy and the rest of the rice and fish can fall out of the end of the roll. The warm rice is one of my favorite about this place and places like Sugarfish. If you have not tried sushi with warm rice and it sounds odd to you, try it here! It is amazing. My favorite roll was the yellowtail one as it was the lightest and most natural in flavor.   Because it was only in soft opening, I had very low expectations and was not expecting to be impressed by anything here. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The fish tasted fresh and the warm rice and crispy combination was great. I don't know if I would come back any time soon as the wait will probably tremendous, but its a great experience to have at least once.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Emmett T.	I had been waiting for this place to open when I first heard about it last year. It's a small, chic bar that seats roughly 20 people so I guess I was fortunate when I arrived as only about half the spots were occupied. I parked a couple of blocks away and walked over since I knew it would be a crap shoot trying to find a space in that plaza.  After you are seated, the server explains how to order the hand rolls from the menu sheet. You mark what you want and then hand the slip to him/her who then informs the chefs behind the bar on what to make. The best value comes from ordering one of the three preset options. I chose the Go ($21.75) which came as five rolls: Blue Crab, Spicy Toro, Negi Salmon, Bay Scallop, Maine Lobster. I also picked a Wagyu Shabu roll ($7.75) a la carte.  I liked how the chefs took each piece of nori and warmed it to a crisp over a gas flame before adding the ingredients. Each roll came out cylindrical in shape (instead of conical like at most Japanese restaurants) and was handed to you individually as the chef finished wrapping it. All the components tasted very fresh. My favorite of the ones I tried was the bay scallop.  The a la carte prices were pretty reasonable as I normally see hand rolls selling between $4 and $5 apiece. All the regular temaki were priced less than $5 while the premium temaki ranged from $5.75 to $7.75. They are currently in their soft opening for the remainder of this week. The plan is to go to their full operating hours early next week according to one of the managers who checked up on me before and after my meal.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Megan F.	Jer and I each did a preset flight of rolls and then added one additional special roll. Each roll was individually crafted and the flavors were fantastic. Everything tasted fresh and tenderly crafted.  The staff was super friendly and attentive.   Our compliments to the chef!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lily N.	I think I found my new favorite place?   Came here Saturday night for dinner with a friend. We made reservations -- it seems like a safe bet since its a small place and a wait could build up pretty fast.  I had the \"San\" set menu, which came with three handrolls --\u00a0Toro, Spicy Salmon, and Blue Crab. I was hesitant to order this since it seemed like a pretty small portion, but the amount was perfect for me (not hungry, but not hate-myself-I'm-so-full). The TORO was by far my favorite, but all three are great choices. Each were super fresh and had absolutely no \"fishy\" smell to it. There's a sufficient amount of mayo in it but not too much, in my opinion. The spicy salmon wasn't like the traditional ones you get in cut rolls or poke bowls -- it had the perfect amount of kick without destroying my palette.  We also got a sake flight. It was ok, but don't know if I would order it again. I'd rather opt for a beer or just one singular type of sake (its nice they give you a \"sake scale\" ranging from sweet to neutral to dry).  The only think to be cautious of is the parking because the lot is super teeny and an absolute nightmare!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Curtis T.	We were trying to get into Kura Robota Sushi Bar. After waiting for 45 minutes, we did a Yelp search and found J Wata Temaki Bar. This is a new restaurant in an area that is packed with Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Japanese restaurants. There are no tables, but only sushi counters. The restaurant primarily serves rolls. There are specialty rolls from 3 (San) to 5 (Go). The Go is the best \"bargain\" at under $22, which includes spicy Toro and Maine lobster rolls. They heat the nori (seaweed), which is a nice touch.   After a nice dinner of 14 hand rolls for the two of us for about $60, we were buzzed by Kura that our table was ready. I will take quality over quantity and will return to J Wata Temaki on my next visit to San Diego.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Catherine F.	I am a sucker for hand rolls, and being from Los Angeles I have not found that restaurant to give me that fix here in San Diego.   Soft Opening, but was really well put together. The space was all in the middle and for everyone seated to experience and be close to the sushi chef.   For my Temaki:  I chose the Shi, which included (4) handrolls: *Blue Crab *Negi Yellowtail- fresh yellowtail and great on the palate. *Spicy Tuna- just enough spice *Bay Scallop- mayo delicate taste and was one of my favorites  I couldn't resist, and tried from the a la carte as well: *Spicy Toro- give me that tuna belly, savory and perfect *Uni- it was different with some mint added and tobiko. I enjoyed this handroll the most!  Each Nori is toasted before preparing each handroll, so your handroll is handed to you by the chef each time warm and ready to eat.   I would definitely come back!  Staff- attentive and management as well  Parking- it's Convoy/Kearny Mesa parking at all those plaza's equals patience.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Katie B.	Delicious. I love the concept since I'm a huge fan of temaki. You can order a set of 3, 4, or 5 temaki (hand rolls). They also have an a la carte menu if you're looking for specific items like uni and ikura. The sets are definitely the way to go to save a little money. I had the set of five: negi salmon, Maine lobster, spicy tuna, hamachi, bay scallop. My mom had the set of three: negi toro, spicy salmon, blue crab. She also had an uni ikura roll. All the rolls were great - delivered straight to the hand by the chef. The rice was pretty good, but could have had a bit more vinegar. At least it wasn't too sweet like a lot of sushi places. The fish was fresh and the nori was nicely toasted right in front of us. There's nothing like the combination of fresh toasted nori, warm sushi rice and cold fish!   We made a reservation, but didn't actually need it when we came at noon on a Sunday. You might need it during happy hour, which looks pretty good. Discounted rolls and beer! Overall, we had a good experience and I liked that we were able to get in and out of this counter joint fairly quickly.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Leslie B.	Wow!  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  I went because the Yelp review of the day suggested, and it looked like a good idea.  I went on a week night with my sushi-loving cousin.  I really love hand rolls, but had never been to a place that specialized in hand rolls.  We made reservations just in case, but there was no crowd on a week night.  It was chilly, so I ordered hot sake.  My cousin, who is super selective in her sake, chose as well, and found some to her liking.   The menu has several options, including a chef's selection of 3, 4, or 5 items.  We chose the four item menu and an appetizer of hamachi cevice.  The service was great. Our server set us up with the sake and the appetizer.  We communicated with our chef about our chef's selection.  The fish was fresh and delicious.  The hand rolls were delicious and I absolutely crave them today.  I am definitely happy to have discovered this place and I will be back.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Grace S.	Came here for their grand opening week 3 to get the opportunity to utilize their BOGO, and chose their \"GO\"  set with 5 hand rolls at 21.95: - salmon - blue crab - spicy tuna - bay scallop - maine lobster  Other choices would have been the 3, 4 or vegetarian set menus, in which you can see if you browse pictures of the menu. You can also order a la carte.  Everything feels very specialized here, as I feel like how most Japanese restaurants are. The seaweed is first lovingly roasted over a flame before being wrapped around warm sushi and delicious cold fish.  The chef is attentive as well as the other servers here, setting out ginger and wasabi, a wet paper towel (one of those in plastic), and a tray of soy sauce, which was pretty concentrated. But of course the star of the experience were the hand rolls. The hand rolls are simply just rolled into a straight roll, not into the triangle/pyramid wrap that so many of are used to at certain restaurants, which makes it easier to dip in the soy sauce.  With each roll, I would take at least one bite without dipping it in the soy sauce and honestly, all of them can be deliciously consumed in that manner as they all had very distinct and strong flavor. My favorite that stood out for me was the maine lobster. The texture just worked for my tongue. Usually I'm much more of a crab person, so I was surprised the blue crab wasn't my favorite. However, all of them were excellent and one could definitely tell the quality of the fish.  These are premium hand rolls, so they come at a price. Don't expect to be stuffed after eating here unless you want to spend a lot.  The experience also comes at a premium with only about room for 20 people here, with about two or three chefs (so the rolls come fast). We were lucky that we had 0 wait as I have heard others waiting an hour sometimes.  I really like the decor, the art murals, and just the general feel of the place. Trendy but not overly gaudy or modern yet tasteful - like at an art museum.  However, just a note that this place is at the complex with the Convoy parking lot from hell, so plan accordingly to either come at off-peak hours or give yourself time to find parking on the street.  I'm really happy that a place like this exists in San Diego - perhaps the restaurant scene has finally arrived since a restaurant that specializes in something as niche as hand rolls opens here.  The whole experience was very pleasant, and I had a terrific time dining here. I'll definitely be back, when I'm craving for some really great hand rolls :)	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Johnny N.	The \"Go\" set menu is the way to go as it will save you approximately $5 from ordering the 5 handrolls individually.  All the seafood used are extremely fresh and the habachi grilled seaweed makes a wonderful warm crunchy wrap.  I was a little disappointed they had no uni today.  My favorite are the bay scallops and especially the blue crab.  They are both so sweet and fresh.  But the blue crab is what will keep me coming back for more since blue crab hand roll serving restaurants are hard to find in San Diego county.  I would even probably just stop by to get myself a few blue crab handrolls as a snack.  I am not cheap on my food but I do find the handrolls to be somewhat small \u0026 expensive.  To make yourself full the final bill tally can get quite high.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Julie N.	Wow, if I wasn't a struggling college student, you would 100% see me here every week. I came in on a Friday around 5ish with my friend. My friend and I wanted to get Cauldron, but we wanted to get something small and savory before we got ice cream.   We saw that J/Wata was open so we went to try it out. This place only serves hand rolls and the menu is small, but boy did everything sound amazing. Hand rolls were around $5-6 per roll, a little on the pricey side but for the fresh ingredients, I totally understand why.   My friend and I just wanted 1 roll each because something savory for our taste buds was all we wanted. I got the negi toro and she got the avo/wasabi/mayo. The chef prepares it right in front of you and personally gives you the hand roll. The roll was so flavorful with really great ingredients, you can taste how fresh it was. I'm not even a fan of mayo or wasabi, and the avo wasabi mayo roll was so good.   Staff members and the chef were super nice and welcoming! I can't wait to return, but definitely with my mom or dad next time!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jay O.	I can't see this place surviving. I've tried to like it after about 5 or 6 visits but it just isn't happening.  Service is always very bad even on a very slow day. The waitress doesn't seem to know what's going on and the kitchen side isn't much better.  Pace is always very slow and they always seem to be training someone new to make rolls.  (I've never seen the same person in the kitchen twice except one guy).   Fish quality is nothing special and the specials haven't changed since they opened (many months ago).	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Deaj Q.	First time at a temaki bar. Both of my parents are avid fans of Junya Watanabe, so visiting here didn't surprise me. My dad and I ventured in while waiting for seats next door at Junya's neighboring ramen shop. We were honestly looking for just appetizers and a drink or two and ended up spending a cool $75 sans tip. L O L.   (We ordered: negi toro, spicy salmon, bay scallop, shiitake shoyu, uni with shiso, unagi x2, wagyu shabu, a beer, and the sake sampler)  James was our chef for the majority of the meal and I think Kim was our host. The meal and service are very structured and for good reason. Order your hand rolls and drinks by notating them on the provided check list, Chef will hand them to you, one at a time, as they are made. D E L I C I O U S. But I can see how the service structure is helpful when it is extremely busy.   I can't tell if it was because my dad was generous from the alch or if we were both just genuinely enthused in our experience but we spent more than enough on our original plan for appetizers and drinks hahahaha.  All of the hand rolls we ordered were fantastic. All of the fish and even vegetarian rolls were premium and exceptional quality--so for me, at this point, decision-making is a matter of what your taste preference is. Of honorable mention, I really loved the bay scallop. So creamy and sweet. Chef offered us palate-cleaning rolls at the end: a pickled radish handroll and a ginger shiso handroll. Both were tasty but if we were to choose one, the ginger handroll reigned supreme.   Thank you, j/wata Temaki Bar!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Akemi W.	Very expensive. Very delicious.  These rolls are made fresh with crisp nori, hot rice, and cold fish. Each one is prepared as you eat it, so there's no takeout, no fancy presentation, no piled plate to take photos of. I could see this taking quite a long time, but I timed my visit for the murky too-late-for-lunch-too-early-for-dinner time and had the place to myself. Even as the only customer, the staff was attentive (but not hover-y), the rice was fresh, and the meal was delicious.  This is definitely a good place to come if you want to eat excellent, quality food without being too fancy.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Edwina O.	This is how Sushi should be served! Hand rolled in front of you and the toasted Nori elevates the taste to a higher level. Very professional yet inviting atmosphere. J Wata is where you go to impress a date.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Brianna N.	Simple and good place for a quick bite! Well.. it's convoy so idk if it's really quick but I went when it wasn't too busy. Had the yellowtail, bluefin, and toro. My friends said the blue crab is the best! I would come here again but it gets pretty pricey and you don't really get too full	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sarah C.	Must try spot if you love hand rolls! I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon with my bf. As we are diehard sushi aficionados, we've always wanted to try a Temaki spot. During our visit, there appeared to only be 2 workers (one chef \u0026 one server) while the restaurant was pretty full for a Monday afternoon. It took us a while to get seated since the 2 workers were trying to manage the workload. As an appetizer, we also ordered from the seasonal specials, the Kanpachi (Amberjack) sashimi. Since it was our first time at a Temaki spot, we decided to try the set menu \u0026 so we ordered \"Go\" which included 5 Temaki \u0026 miso soup. The price wasn't bad for the amount you get but if you order from the set menu, there are absolutely no substitutions.   The Kanpachi sashimi was amazing! Kanpachi is one of my favorite fish for sushi \u0026 it didn't disappoint. It was very fresh \u0026 light; we could've easily devoured an entire plate of it! The first Temaki was the Negi Salmon \u0026 it was great. Salmon isn't typically one of my top picks but the freshness \u0026 quality won me over! The second was the Maine Lobster. The lobster was cooked to perfection \u0026 there was a good balance between it \u0026 the sauce it was mixed with. I always fear that the delicate flavor of the lobster would get lost in excessive amounts of sauce. The third was the Spicy Tuna which had a good kick of spice but we thought it was just alright. I thought that the Spicy Tuna wasn't anything special because personally, it always has that same, one note flavor to me regardless of where I try it from. I think there are other fishes that have flavors that are more profound \u0026 unique. The fourth was the Hamachi Golden Ratio \u0026 it was the BEST! The name for this Temaki was very appropriate because the flavors were cohesive in the marinate of the fish. The fifth \u0026 final was the Bay Scallop \u0026 to be frank, it was a bit of a disappointment. Like the Maine Lobster, the Bay Scallop was also tossed in a sauce but I thought the sauce was overwhelming, heavy \u0026 clouded the delicate, subtle flavor of the scallop.   In terms of service, it did take some time for us to finally start receiving our Temaki's because the chef was swamped \u0026 looked like he was pretty behind on orders. On a good note, reinforcements arrived from the back so there were 2 more workers alongside the chef. At this point, the food was coming out faster but I can tell the patrons who were there before us were pretty frustrated, possibly wondering why these workers didn't come sooner. The chef even apologized to some patrons, assuring them that this service doesn't reflect their regular service. Unfortunately, we received our Kanpachi sashimi at the end of our meal because the chef forgot about it but it was delicious nonetheless.   Overall, we had a great first time experience at a Temaki restaurant. The ambiance is great \u0026 the place is very trendy \u0026 modern. I love how all the seats are bar style so that you can observe the chefs \u0026 they hand you all the pieces directly. One of my favorite things about the food is that there's a perfect balance in flavor, texture \u0026 proportion between the rice, the crispiness of the roasted Nori \u0026 the fish elements. I could tell they utilize high quality ingredients not only for fish but also for the Nori \u0026 the sushi rice prep. Though the food doesn't come out fast, I appreciate the time that goes into hand making each piece. Having dined at quite a few traditional, Japanese sushi restaurants, I knew that those chefs like to take their time to perfect each piece so we came in knowing it wouldn't be a fast dining experience. They also recommend that you eat every piece as soon as it comes out \u0026 for good reason because the crispy, roasted Nori is a major component in Temaki \u0026 if you wait too long, it'll get soggy. I'd love to visit again but I think I'd order a la carte next time to try the other selections!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Helena Q.	WOW!  This place is delicious!!  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in SD now.  The chefs who prepare the hand rolls take great care, and let me tell you, every single hand roll my friend and I tried was great.  It's a small restaurant, with a nice ambiance.  Great date spot!  Each hand roll is made to order and only after you finish your last one does the chef make another.    The concept is that nori is wrapped into a cone with rice and fish.  The nori is toasted over a high flame, so that it doesn't taste chewy - thank you!  The fish tasted fresh, and the rice was perfect.  Since the dessert shop, Angels \u0026 Hearts, is opened by the same owner, you can even get a discount if you go after dinner by showing your receipt!  What a sweet deal!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jessica T.	Tasty and satisfying hand rolls that are worth the price! You can choose from a set menu and/or buy rolls individually.   Ordered the Go set ($21.75) which comes with salmon, lobster, spicy tuna, scallop, and blue crab hand rolls and added on a blue fin tuna roll ($4). They were all pretty good, but my favorites were the salmon, lobster, and scallop.   My friend ordered the uni ikura roll and was impressed with it as well! I usually find ikura too salty, but I really liked the sample I was given. It's first washed to lessen its saltiness. Then it's marinated overnight in a soy sauce (?) mixture, which gives it a flavorful yet delicate taste.  I'd come back if I'm ever down to splurge to try the rest of the menu!   *This place is better than kazunori in LA.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Michelle N.	My fianc\u00e9 is a huge hand roll fan, so we came here for lunch over the weekend. It's a small restaurant with a U-shaped communal table that allows you to get real close to your neighbors and the sushi chef. (This place is in that convoy tapx plaza where green tea house cafe used to be..10 years ago lol.)  Food is delicious and filling. We each ordered the 5-roll pack w an extra specialty roll apiece. Hands down my fave is the lobster hand roll. Oh and the buttery delicious bay scallops roll. I'm still having dreams about them!!!  Gotta give a shout out to the awesome sushi chef, James. I love watching food network, so I was thrilled when he answered a few of my questions and explained how the rolls and their components are made. I think a lot of times in these smaller restaurants, the atmosphere is really set by the chef, and he did a great job setting the atmosphere.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Theresa H.	I think that many don't understand that this is a specialty hand roll restaurant, with that being said, let's continue.  Luckily for me and my S/O, we used their grand opening special, buy one set and get one set, so we were allowed to binge a little. We got the \"go\" set, which includes Maine Lobster, Spicy Tuna, Bay Scallop, Negi Salmon, and Blue Crab.   The service was great, a server seats you around the chef, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend a large group to come in. The fun thing about the seating is that you get to see the chefs roast the seaweed, and hand roll everything right in front of you. The seaweed is roasted on an open fire, and this is done so that it has a nice crunch, roasted flavor that compliments the hand roll.   They give you the roll when you're ready, what that means is that every roll is made fresh for you to enjoy the roll one at a time.  Blue crab - This was surprisingly really sweet due to the fresh crab, although a little bit too much mayo Spicy Tuna - taste like a little bit better than average spicy tuna Bay Scallop - I liked this one the best, but some people might not like the texture of the scallops, it was light and fresh Negi Salmon - Also tasted like an elevated salmon Maine Lobster - Fresh, made up for the crab with less mayo  Everything was very thought out texturally with the melt in your mouth fish, and the crunchy seaweed. But it's not an average \" sushi\" place, it's a handroll place that wants you to taste what they offer which are hand rolls! If you've got the time, and a little more money, go ahead and sit down here to eat. But other wise, treat this place as a little pre-game for your other meals to come around convoy	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Evee N.	Came here with a fairly large group, knowing we might have to split up or deal with a longer wait. Good thing it was a Monday afternoon, they were able to seat 6 of us altogether. Like previous reviews have mentioned, it's a slower paced meal since you are being fed only as fast as your chef can go.  SHI - 4 handrolls Blue Crab - this was my least favorite of the 3, all I could taste was the mayo Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon, Bay Scallop - all so simple, yet tasty  Unagi - this was a slightly different flavor that I still enjoyed. Unagi is usually prepared with a sweet sauce, and\u00a0@J Wata the sweetness is toned down.  I liked that we could watch the chefs prepare the handrolls, from toasting the nori to placing it in your hand. Though it was good eats, it wasn't amazing amazing y'know?	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Heather P.	My favorite sushi place!  So fresh and delicious.  My favorites are the hamachi and negi toro.  They have a great lunch special with miso soup, salad, and two hand rolls that I get at least once a week!  The chefs and staff are so friendly.  It's my go to.  Don't ever change J Wata!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Katherine H.	First to pop up in San Diego. Delightful culinary experience. The seafood was fresh and hand rolls made one at a time with care. There are only a few seats, which causes a line. Everyone was amazingly helpful and nice. The blue crab and spicy tuna hand rolls were my fave. Great date night location.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Christopher S.	A very nice change up from your normal sushi spots.  Food and service is incredible. Depending on how busy it is it may take some time for you to get your first set of hand rolls but it is definitely worth the wait.   Highly recommend going during happy hour so you can get drinks and some rolls at a discounted price which makes the experience more worth it.  Must try!!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	teresa v.	I've been here now a handful of times and it has yet to disappoint! Highly recommend going for the 5-set so you can try more of a variety and to fill up -- and 3 to 4 is not enough to get full. LOVE how the chef gives it to you one at a time and roasts the seaweed as he goes (always great seeing Chef Mas behind the bar, whether to watch over the other chefs or making the rolls himself).  I would say this place has not yet been fully discovered (yay for me!), but would def recommend others check out this hidden gem!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kim P.	Best hand rolls I've ever had. Enjoyed everything but favorites were lobster and scallops hand roll. The crispy shrimp was also delicious. Would definitely recommend!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jinna K.	Not my style. Super bland and really, nothing extraordinary. We got the 5 hand rolls each. It was spicy tuna, bay scallops, Maine lobster, blue crab and salmon. The lobster, scallops and crab are slathered in mayo. I felt like they really didn't take advantage of the fresh seafood natural flavors and was geared towards a more mainstream, \"American\" flavor. They didn't taste bad, just very bland and lackluster. The chef (James) was very courtesy and did what he could do. We ordered a few specials/appetizers and one of them came with miso soup. We asked if we can get our miso soup since it took a while, the waitress said we had to order it so we told her we ordered a the set of 5 Temaki and it came with it. She then said \"did you want it?\" We just said yes....  The service wasn't terrible. Our waiter was fine and chef was nice. It's just one chef for the entire table but he was able to keep up with the pace. I think they could improve on really amplifying the freshness and quality of the fish rather than slathering it mayo. It tastes so Americanized like a Cali roll.   It's just not my taste. I can see why people love this place and have it good reviews, it's just not my preferred taste.   Also, keep calling the grated chopped wasabi \"fresh\" wasabi when it's not. Idk where people get this from but I would have to assume they were told that.   I, personally would not recommend. But again, It's just not my preference. I can see someone trying to transition from California or philly rolls to sashimi that want to be \"adventurous\".	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Hillary F.	We ordered the monkey balls, Negi salmon and salmon skin roll plus the San (3) Tamaki set which comes with miso soup , a negi toro, blue crab, and spicy salmon roll.  Everything tastes fresh and you can tell the ingredients are of high quality.  We will defiantly come back here next time we are in the area.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Brandon F.	I've been excited to try this place since they opened, but I've always assumed it's super busy.. especially being located in such a busy area in Convoy. To my surprise, there was no wait on a Friday night at 7:00 pm! It was near empty, with just 1 couple dining upon our arrival. I also found parking right away, I'll admit that was sheer luck.   I love the concept and simple menu. You order your hand rolls, and they make them fresh for you one at a time. This makes for a fun and unique dining experience that ultimately fills you up. It's also pretty quick, we were in and out fairly fast.   My girlfriend and I had 5 hand rolls each. Keep in mind, they're not as big as your typical hand roll at other places, but don't over order, because you could always order more later.   My girlfriend's favorite was the main lobster. My personal favorite were the shiitake and yellowtail. We ordered the wagyu, and it was mediocre at best. Then my toro was just okay, for all I knew it could have been regular tuna.   Overall I'd rate the experience 3.5 stars, but going to round down. $75 later including tip for 2, it was fun, but not memorable. To their credit, the service was good, and it's a nice and quick dining experience. Then make sure to try the shiitake. Unfortunately the wagyu was a disappointment, and the toro was questionable. Then the overall fish quality was not any better then your average sushi place, so I'll likely not be back.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kelly H.	Love their blue crab and lobster.  Very fresh!  You can now use yelp to make reservations which makes it easier during Friday and Saturday.  I like their fresh ingredients and would like to see them expanding the selections a bit more.  Recently they added some sake tasting which is a plus!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lydia T.	I love when an establishment sticks to one thing and does it well! J Wata is the spot for yummy small handrolls with crisp seaweed. OMG.  It's just a small u-shaped bar, modern and intimate.  The miso was tasty!   We selected the \"Go\" (means 5) (x2) so we could sample their offerings. Our fave was the negi salmon. I also really liked the spicy scallop (not spicy but yummy creaminess) and the blue crab. We needed another negi salmon and the uni a la carte. The uni was very refreshing with an oba leaf and roe.   The staff were very nice and attentive. They adjust the pacing accordingly and we were never without a hand roll for long. I can't wait to go back!  Arigato gozaimasu	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Thuong T.	Three Words: Premium hand rolls.  I love the uniqueness of this Japanese restaurant, specifically brought to you so that you can enjoy a whole new experience of sushi. It is indeed, a very simple dish, and you'd imagine \"how hard could it be to mess up?\" Well darling, you can.   \"THE PRECISE COMBINATION OF SUSHI GRADE FISH, WARM RICE AND CRISP SEAWEED, PAIRED WITH CHEF WATANABE'S SECRET SAUCES CREATE A UNIQUE DINING EXPERIENCE.\" - CHEF JUNYA WATANABE  (CREATOR OF RAKIRAKI RAMEN AND POKIRRITO POKE)  HAMACHI SASHIMI Super fresh slices of hamachi, drenched in a flavorful sauce, and topped off with a spicy kick of jalapeno. It is one of my favorite dishes and they did not disappoint.  GO [5] TEMAKI  (All hand roll combos cannot be substituted or shared)  BLUE CRAB(GF) - The crab was immensively flavorful. My second favorite. SPICY TORO (GF) - Fresh, Yummy NEGI SALMON (GF) - Fresh, Yummy BAY SCALLOP (GF) - The scallops were beautifully marinated in a creamy sauce. My favorite! MAINE LOBSTER (GF) - Fresh, Delicious  UNAGI (Premium Roll/A La Carte) - Super tender and slightly sweet, delicious!  Overall, all the ingredients, from the slightly crisped Nori seared over an open flame, to the tender rice, to the freshness of the proteins, and the subtle but flavorful sauces, to the customer service was wonderful.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jessica C.	Such a fun and delicious eating experience. We love coming here for just a snack or for a full meal. Everything is worth trying.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Victoria O.	Like so many great Convoy spots, this little gem is tucked into a strip mall and easily overlooked due to its more established surroundings. It's always a treat to find ourselves here as the concept is simple yet thrilling and, above all, well-executed. To have hand rolls made one-by-one and handed over directly from the chefs is already a step above most any other restaurant around, but then to also have the flavors of each selection speak to the ingredients within takes it to a whole new level. There's nothing like it in San Diego and I hope they find the traction they need to thrive as they're doing quiet, excellent work.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lori T.	Came in during their soft opening and I'll start by saying that I'm looking forward to seeing their menu expand because everything that we ordered was good.  The hand rolls are made fresh one at a time in front of you and it's best to eat them right away to maintain the fresh crunch of the seaweed. My mistake was taking my time in snapping pics of my first few handrolls haha. The blue crab and scallop rolls were my favorite - the blue crab was slightly sweet and the meat was refreshing, light, and fresh by the smell of it. The scallop was just the same - slightly sweet with a clean aftertaste and texture. The salmon and hamachi sashimi were both served with just the right amount of accompanying ponzu and wasabi and the slices were fresh. My rec is to go for the \"shi temaki\" which is an order of blue crab, negi yellowtail, spicy salmon, and bay scallop handrolls then you can order more as you please. I'd skip on the Maine lobster - it's not out of the ordinary.   I think that the way the rolls are served should be changed - rather than handing it directly to the customer, it could be placed in front of them. I felt like I was going to drop my handrolls because it's a little awkward having to grab/set the roll in your hand. Just my two cents!   Overall, I highly recommend for the experience and quality of food. The parking lot isn't great as it is the same one shared with Tapex and Tofu House and if you know, you know...	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Annie L.	YES. JUST YES! If you love Temaki (hand rolls) you'll love it here. The Bay Scallops, Spicy Tuna, Wagyu Shabu are absolutely delicious! They have a special Temaki right now, Spicy Jumbo Shrimp Tempura which is also amazing. You also have to understand that your entire dining experience will take over an hour, your Temaki comes out one at a time, so expect to wait. All in all, A+!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jasmine C.	S P E E C H L E S S ! I have been to many sushi places and this place is one of its own kind.   The experience was different here. You walk in and there is only a round about bar setting. You sit as if you are in a bar but you order sushi. The sushi is made for you one by one and they hand it to you one at a time. Similar concept to as if you are ordering a drink at the bar and they hand you one drink at a time.   Everything is premium and fresh. Customer service is great. The Sushi Chef was very attentive and he went along with our instagram posts. He smiled on camera when we took pictures of him preparing our food. He was entertaining.   I just hoped the restaurant would be bigger with more seating. There is a higher demand I noticed. My friend and I waited about an hour and a half to get seated.   Parking is a mess but there is street parking as well. The food is worth having a struggle with parking.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tiffany L.	I've been here twice now, once during the soft opening and the second time during their grand opening when they had their set menu BOGO.  There are only around ~20 seats so while this makes for an intimate, authentic atmosphere reminiscent of a sushi restaurant in Japan, it is probably not the best place to go if you have a party over 3-4 people.  This place is great if you're not super hungry and you're looking for quality/freshness over quantity.  They only serve hand rolls and each roll is prepared fresh to order and should be consumed within seconds of receiving it from the chef.  While I do appreciate this concept, it does make the meal last longer and the pacing of your meal is at the mercy of how busy the restaurant is.  You should expect to wait 5-10 minutes between each roll.  However, the service is very attentive from the chefs, servers, and manager.  The chef always asked me how each roll was in between rounds and seemed genuinely interested in my response as opposed to just asking for the sake of it.  The servers came around often to refill waters as well as their high quality soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi.  I normally don't even like sushi ginger but I really enjoy the freshness of the ginger here!  The food itself is delish.  I had the Shi and Go menus during my respective visits.  The chefs hand-roast the seaweed before filling it and that crunchy exterior really ties everything together.  All the fillings are fresh and seasoned well.  My favorites are probably the salmon, yellowtail, and lobster rolls :)	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Adrienne A.	Oh man, where do I begin?   Everything I had was DELICIOUS! *****  Spicy Salmon- Perfect!  Spicy Toro- Perfect!   The Blue Crab was my favorite :)   I had no warning before I bit into the Uni special... my mouth went on a journey through the universe. So many flavors~  Thanking my lucky stars !! I was given fresh raw wasabi... I ate all of it. I think it got me high :D just kidding, I know it did!!!  Even the wasabi you are normally given here was the best I've ever had, as well as the ginger.  The Chefs oh ma gaaaaaaaaaaaaaa GORGEOUS!!! Faints :)   Big crazy parking lot!!!!! I will avoid places if parking is to difficult, but for this? For this I will fight! I will take you DOWWWN!!! LoL   Fantastic service! Great decor to stare at after you're high from the wasabi and delicious food :D   Nice restrooms!   See you in my dreams!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Marika D.	Man, I had such high expectations for this place being an avid consumer of seafood and Japanese cuisine. But it really did not live up to it in the slightest bit.   For a place that specializes in hand rolls, they sure make a sloppy one. It's very hard to eat without them falling apart. I do like that they warm up the seaweed and that it has a nice crunch. But inside the nori is 75% rice. Very little seafood, which wouldn't be an issue if the price was affordable. But these are expensive handrolls at $5-10 each.   The San, which included Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon \u0026 Blue Crab, was very unsatisfying. They were all so heavily marinated that you couldn't taste the fish itself. Especially the crab was more mayo tasting than anything.  We also ordered the hamachi sashimi to get a change from all the rice. Yellowtail is my favorite fish, and I find that it is usually good even at mediocre sushi spots. But this one was actually pretty bad.  It was served room temperature and the texture tasted somewhat dry. This confirmed to me that the fish they use here is not the freshest and highest of quality.   In my opinion, they need to source better seafood and use less sauce/rice, or reduce their prices to match the quality.   +1 star for the ambiance +1 for the concept	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Yoder O.	Totally blown away by how delicious the food was. I'm giving this place a 5 star although is has some cons but the food and experience was that good.  Food choice: GO x2 (mind-blowingly Delicious)  Pros: The hand roll is made fresh right in front of you and served one at a time. It's so freaking delicious that you can't wait for the another one and then another one. The sushi chefs are super friendly and engaging.  Cons: The place is small but intimate. We came with a party of 8 and had to be split into 4 groups which was awkward to yell across the room to talk to a friend. The prices are also a bit out of hand but thankfully we came at the grand opening week and got a buy one get one free deal. Lastly, getting the food fresh out of the chef's hand was so unique but also means waiting around for 2 chefs to serve 20 people can be irritating.  Overall: I will be coming back and can't wait to try everything on the menu.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kendra A.	This place IS SOOOOO TASTY!!! Their lunch specials are fantastic and super affordable. It's a tiny lil place but man it's absolutely delicious and the employees are the sweetest. Kim, you're awesome!  We got the Hamachi Kama and duuuuuude so fresh! Finger lickin good :)	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sang P.	Came here around 11:15 AM on a weekday. The place was about 30% full. I ordered the \"GO\" because why not GO all out?  I don't think it's fair to compare sushi places in the US to the ones in Japan. The style that J Wata serves is very similar to the extremely popular Kazunori in Los Angeles. Don't expect sashimi inside your temaki. Also, the rice wasn't quite seasoned for sushi (don't expect akasu or komai, etc) but that's still okay. I think it could be borderline pretentious if someone puts that much effort into the rice for San Diego - given that the price range does not justify that much detail anyway - who cares!  The rule still stands similar to Japan and the US alike: eat as soon as possible when the chef hands it to you to keep the crispiness of the seaweed.  The temakis were good - I liked the lobster the most. I'd love to try to Uni+Ikura next time but I was pretty full from the meal. In the future, I'd prefer more handrolls with sashimi in them but I know that's pretty difficult to do given the prep time, etc.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jessica S.	Traditionally, temaki is made from leftovers and packed as a lunch, SO only in America will you see it offered in a restaurant and as an exotic, high-end dinner item. This 'bar' serves temaki strictly; seating is very limited. Typically, temaki is cone-shaped, but this restaurant and others have been going with the super hip 'rolled taco' version. Nori is held over a flame to warm and crisp it, then the rice is packed in with the protein on top. It is rolled by your chef and handed to you on the spot.   We came during the soft opening, so there wasn't much of a wait just before 6pm hit. Options at the time offered 3 set menus and some items a la carte. A little irked that the set menus included a little disclaimer of 'no sharing'. Who the hell are they to tell me how to eat MY food that I paid for!? Anyways, I went for *Shi* which included blue crab, negi yellowtail, spicy salmon, and bay scallop for $16.75. Sound a bit pricey? Indeed it is and you won't feel full after 4. I did mightily enjoyed the bay scallops the most though -- such a pop of freshness with the creamy mayo serving as a marinade. The others options were alright. Most seemed to rely heavily on the marinade. In that respect I did enjoy the *wagyu shabu* which I did have to order a la carte for a $7.75! This did not have a marinade and you were able to enjoy the lusciousness of the meat itself. The offering of wagyu was small and because of that I don't believe the $7.75 was a fair price. I wasn't a fan of the *negi toro* as it had a funny texture since it was a bit mashed up. I guess that's how it normally is so it does take some getting used to.   Nori was ever so slightly warm and it maybe offered a little crunch. Rice was ON POINT though. In addition to the freshness of the fish, the rice is definitely another important component and they make it right here; moist, but firm.   I am fairly certain the owner of RakiRaki will kill it though since there is nothing like this San Diego. I have a love-hate relationship with the man, but he offered a polished menu in a very well thought out and aesthetically pleasing restaurant. Congratulations on capitalizing on the next cool concept Junya Watanabe!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Candice L.	I mean, wow! First of all, great service and the was very friendly! I came for a BOGO promotion during their grand opening so there was a bit of a line but well worth it! I got the GO option which has Maine Lobster included, my fav! The soy was is double fermented (bomb) and the wasabi wasn't that fake stuff.  Not a huge spicy tuna fan but this wasn't the best spicy tuna I've ever had! It was FRESH! Must come here for some hand-rolls!  A bit on the smaller side, but he beat quality.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Rony Y.	The food is very good. The service not that much, they are understaffed, and they are slow between hand rolls.  Also, the place does not close at 9. I have gotten there 4 times at 8:15 and they wouldn't take me, even with the place empty.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Isabella B.	After the successes of RakiRaki and Pokiritto chef-owner Junya Watanabe has launched another restaurant concept - this time focusing on temaki (hand rolls). While there are plenty of sushi places that serve rolls or nigiri, not a lot of restaurants even offer temaki on the menu, much less exclusively serve them. Before this restaurant existed I could only get good handrolls from the famous Sugarfish as part of their set menu. At least now I don't have to go that far for temaki.  LOCATION: Convoy/Kearny Mesa in the same complex as the original Rakiraki and Pokiritto. As with any other restaurant in that area, parking situation's awful but at least this is my only negative critique about the restaurant.  VENUE: The restaurant's pretty small. A central sushi bar seats 22. Three to four chefs toast the nori in these special clay pots that contain the flame.   SERVICE: Friendly service. Hostess kept on asking us how our experience was.  The temaki is assembled right in front of you; they toast the nori, scoop the rice and fish, roll it and hand it to you. No need for chopsticks and oshibori is provided to wipe your hands before touching the sushi.  Our party chose from a set menu. My mom also included salmon sashimi ($7.25) as well as an additional negi yellowtail temaki ($4.75). Salmon sashimi was fresh. Didn't need so much sesame and soy sauce.  Set Menu - Go [5] ($21.75) There is a progression in the seafood that goes from the lightest to the heaviest. 1. Maine Lobster: the lightest temaki, as it should be. The lobster is already diluted with rice. They use a good quality lobster for this roll. 2. Spicy Toro: Salmon and tuna have both a spicy and a negi variation. The fish is pounded until the final product resembles cat food. There is enough hotness for it to be noticeable but not too much that it takes over the fish. 3. Negi Salmon: The negi in this case refers to green onion. In this case it lessens the fishy flavor. Since I'm not served the fatty parts of the fish I like #2 and #3 equally. 4. Bay Scallop: The bay scallop has mayonnaise in it and served warm. Final product is still quite delicious. 5. Blue Crab: Lots of good crab meat. Though I prefer Sugarfish's version, the blue crab is still fresh. Rice - Sushi-grade rice cooked in a small batch technique seasoned with 3 types of vinegar. Nori - Gold labeled seaweed sourced from Yamamotoyama  My parents and I came during their soft opening. We were pretty impressed with our experience in terms of quality of food and service. I could see this restaurant ending up in our regular rotation for places to go out, especially as good Japanese food is hard to find. Just bear the parking.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Myphuong L.	TIP: Do not come starving. You will leave disappointed and still hungry then make your way down to Caldron to fill yourself on the puffle like we did. I would consider this a snack or delicate meal.  Came here at 6:30pm during soft opening (6/10/) and the place had three others seated. Which was a bit awkward when literally everyone can hear your conversations due to the confined space. Especially the chef directly in front of you.  We were told each roll was crafted carefully and recommended to be eaten as soon as it was handed to you. That's exactly what we did. It was so good that I forgot to take photos! We ordered the 4 roll set menu and the scallop was my number one but they were all delicious.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Rae C.	I decided to treat my boyfriend to date night. We really enjoy sushi, and we haven't found our \"go to sushi spot\" since moving away from Long Beach. I wouldn't say J Wata hits the spot for us, but we did enjoy our dining experience while here.   Many sushi documentaries will explain the true passion that goes into sushi rice alone before discussing the fish. Every part of sushi making (nori, rice, fish, presentation...) is very methodical with intense attention to detail. At J Wata, I definitely got to taste of that kind of passion. Our sushi chef was very kind to make our hand rolls and explain his process, even talking about the fish and flavor notes to consider while eating. He educated us on eating sushi and his personal opinions, and was even throwing in some fish humor. It made the date more memorable than I even planned.   Food alone it was good, but having that kind of customer service was truly special. Regardless of the crappy parking lot, or maybe the fact that we were the first patrons of the night and it wasn't busy at all during our time, this place is simply dope.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sandra S.	My friend and I came at around 10:45am during the soft opening, and there wasn't a wait, plus plenty of parking in the notoriously difficult parking lot that the restaurant is located in. The restaurant is very small, with about twenty seats at a sushi counter top. In the middle, the chefs make the hand rolls, while people sit around the sushi bar.   I was somewhat skeptical of how good a hand roll could be, but to my surprise, the experience was very good. We went for the four-piece hand roll set that came with spicy salmon, scallops, yellowtail, and blue crab. My favorite of the four was yellowtail, since it was the sashimi in its pure form without any additional toppings or add ins. The scallop and blue crab rolls had fillings mixed with a mayonnaise type of sauce, and the spicy salmon was only mildly spicy.  The rice was soft and well seasoned, and the nori was crispy and warm. The cool fish contrasted well with the warm rice and nori, and I highly recommend eating it the second the chef hands it to you! The service was also very good, and the waitress was very attentive of our needs throughout the dining experience. I feel like this place will get busy really soon, so I would recommend coming early or before it opens to ensure a spot. Also, this restaurant isn't too good for large crowds, but it's perfect for a 2-3 people lunch date.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Walter M.	First things first, the price will probably give pause to many \"sushi\" lovers out there, but the small, intimate setting, welcoming d\u00e9cor and quality of product will keep you here.  Unfortunately here in Western culture sushi has become synonymous with rolls where the filling is wrapped inside out of the rice and cut. Based on sales and knowledge most people think nigiri or rolls, but the more true versions to eat are the maki and temaki rolls where the nori is on the outside with a proper proportion of fillings. All too often places overstuff rolls with rice and filling and they drown in sauces and toppings.   It's small, quiet, the customer service from both the chef and staff is amazing. I found the salmon sashimi was a great appetizer. The bay scallop was delicate. Something you'll notice is the premium ingredients. The rice in and of itself is great, the nori, properly toasted and crisp, the balance of rice to fish is perfect. The simplicity begets tradition.   I actually only came here because the lines next door were too long and I was parked illegally. They have some kinks to work out on the operations side, the marketing side and to convert an entire sushi people to unlearn a culture. It's ambitious to do something different, but I think to realty grab the hearts and minds of a demographic it has to be approachable, even if mildly to the wallet and maybe in not such a densely concentrated Asian food epicienter.  Update to come.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Scout B.	I've never had sushi of any kind that could compare to this place. I'm not an expert at all but I think anyone can tell how fresh and delicious it is.   Another thing I've noticed is that unlike most sushi places or even just restaurants in general - it may seem that three or four little temaki rolls won't be enough, and usually I'll walk out after sushi still somehow not feeling full after maybe 2-3 times as much.  The seafood here is so high quality that it's fulfilling in pretty small quantities. That's how good it is - it's real, pure food, not empty calories. I dunno but that was honestly a bit surprising to me, in a very good way of course. The appetizers are fantastic just like the temaki itself, of course.  It's not even that expensive, either! They have lunch specials and happy hour that go even cheaper without sacrificing any quality.  The chefs and servers are super nice, too, and I tend to see them casually chatting with customers as they're preparing food. The entire place has a really relaxing vibe and it's a perfect size.   The only real issue that I've had here is sometimes your order will get messed up - like one of the sets of temaki is meant to come with miso soup, which never did last time I went. And you have to make sure to mark everything correctly on the menu, another time my friend made a mistake but let the server know and still was served things she didn't mean to order.  None of that is a big issue at all, though. Everyone's so nice that I'm sure if you let them know they made a mistake they'd be sure to fix it - we just didn't bother because the food was so good we didn't even care.   So yeah, be sure you get what you're ordering but as long as you don't have any allergies, no matter what you get it's going to be delicious!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jannie T.	The whole experience was very underwhelming for me. Service was decent, I wasn't too happy that I had to ask my chef almost each time what handroll he was serving me. He would put it in my hand and walk away without saying anything. The idea of the nori being crispy sounds cool but parts of the nori would sometimes get stuck to the roof of my mouth. I really liked bay scallops and the blue crab hand rolls. I ordered the ikura and uni handroll and was NOT thrilled there was a mint (?) leaf in there! It overtook the flavor of the ikura and uni. Sigh :(  Glad I came here for the BOGO set offer. I don't think I'll be back. Handrolls were 3.5/5 stars good but not worth the size and price I'm paying for.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Aaron C.	J Wata is the best sushi experience in San Diego by far. And I say experience and not restaurant, because coming here is quite an EXPERIENCE. Fresh made to order hand rolls, each individually crafted one by one and to be eaten right after handed to you. Cuts of some of the best seafood, atop perfectly cooked sushi rice, wrapped in freshly roasted seaweed.  Nothing complicated, just the impeccable quality of every ingredient that you sure can taste... even the soy sauce tastes amazing!  My favorite hand rolls are the scallop, Maine lobster, and negi toro! But you really can't go wrong with anything else they have!   They also have rotating appetizers and are always good as well. Be sure to check out what seasonal items they have when you go.   I also have to applaud how I receive consistently superior service here. All the sushi chefs are friendly and attentive, and they time the delivery of the rolls perfectly. Meaning your next hand roll comes a few minutes after you finish your previous one.  So do yourself a favor and try temaki style sushi at J Wata. You won't be disappointed!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Christopher L.	Temaki is a concept that is new to me personally and honestly I enjoyed it.   We went for their grand opening event where it was buy one set menu, get one free which was a great deal!   We were seated right way when the place opened and were told about how their restaurant system works. After ordering our set menu, a chef would make our rolls and literally hand it to us one by one. They suggested we eat it right away to get the full effect of the roasted seaweed texture along with whatever filling we got.   We got the Go set menu which everything was pretty tasty. They use this sweet cream sauce to mix their fish in which complimented the crab, lobster, and scallops really well. I can imagine for the seafood connoisseurs though that they would feel like the cream over powered the actual meat but whatever.  The scallop to me was amazing. It's individual sweetness came through perfectly. The roasted seaweed wrap had a perfect crunch, something I've never experienced before. I guess the fact that it is roasted seconds before it is served to you really makes a difference.   The vibe I got from the restaurant was pretty cool. It was like modern and classic japanese decor infused together.   The whole meal experience was laid back and gave you the opportunity to relax and chat with whoever you're eating with. Don't expect a quick meal especially if there are a lot of people being served. The rolls came every few minutes which allowed me to savor each bit and get all the flavors.   I recommend coming here to give it a try and see if you like it!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Steve H.	Soft opening as of 7/7, so menu may change.  It's in the TightParKing Stripmall with RakiRaki.  Don't even try..  street park three blocks away and walk.  This place is all bar seating, one big U shape.  This makes the service personal and direct.  Friendly, fresh, and.. uniquely human.  The chef makes each handroll and hands it to you directly.  Pacing is up to you.  Very nice, and an easy place to dine solo or small parties.  I went with the midsize 4-roll combo.  No substitutions, but cheaper than the same rolls individually.  I'd call it lunch-sized..  you won't leave stuffed or starving.  These are open ended rolls, not the more common conical ones.  It's just rice and mixed fish ingredients, fresh, but without the greens and garnishes you might be expecting.  The flavors were good, but the hand roll format just doesn't floor me.  It's smaller than a sushi roll, and more seaweed-shell/nori than regular nigiri sushi.  The contents are good, but get a bit overshadowed in all that crunch and wrap, especially near the ends.  Best value on the menu was the hamachi sashimi, with jalapeno slices.  Very fresh thick slices, artfully arranged.  I would get that again.  Iced green tea was just a UCC can, not the fresh matcha you get at Ken's.  Wasabi was really weak, just vanished.  Value was a bit on the expensive side, especially compared to Pokeritto next door.  Service was very helpful and friendly, but this one-format menu might not be for everyone.  Five stars for service and novelty, but I think once was enough for me.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Alanna C.	Came here for the BOGO grand opening event. The wait was around 25 min to get seated ( there are only around 25 or so seats- would be difficult for large parties).   Sushi is always on the expensive side... and this place is no exception, each hand roll is around $4-$5. And around 4 bites in size. It was nice they were having the BOGO otherwise this restaurant would be slightly out of my price range.   The service was quick, after ordering (shi and go sets) it took about 7 min for the chef to greet us and then another 3-4 min to get our roll. Their style is to serve one roll at a time for ultimate freshness. Between each roll there was a 3-4 min wait for the next.   My favorites were the lobster (very tender and the crunch of the seaweed added texture to the lobster) and the blue crab. The scallops had too much mayonnaise for me. I also enjoyed the spicy salmon.  The concept of this place is innovative and new so I feel like that will attract people even if the food is pricey and parking is somewhat difficult.   I would probably be back if they had another deal just on pricey side for me although the food is delicious and atmosphere is nice!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Claire D.	Very happy that San Diego now has a temaki bar! Ever since I went to Kazunori in LA I was hoping we would get one. They are still in their soft opening so the hours aren't set. They would be an ideal quick but delicious (and pricey) lunch, although parking might take too long to visit on a standard lunch break. Really, that parking lot is insane. And some times you can't even find anything 2 blocks on the street in any direction! Anyway...  The menu is simple and the quality of the food is good. The only problem I had is that the rolls kind of fell apart a bit. If you tried to turn it anything but vertical rice fell into the soy. If you held it vertical and took a bite, rice fell out the bottom. Maybe this is something they could fix in the future. My husband and I got 4 handrolls each and it was a $40 lunch without tip. The freshly crisped nori makes it so good though. I like it and hope to come back soon.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ryan L.	Went with a friend for the grand opening event. The atmosphere was pretty cool. I liked the art on the walls, music, and lighting. Service was ok.   We were seated in these lower seats in the dining area which were kind of secluded. It was  out of the way so we couldn't see the sushi chef making stuff and he would only briefly come over to give us our rolls. We could also see the trash behind the counter and the guy bussing dirty dishes was coming right in front of us.  The menu has sets of handrolls that go from 3, 4, or 5 rolls or vegetarian as well as a la carte rolls, appetizers, etc.   We got the \"go(\u4e94)\" set which had 5 handrolls: Salmon, lobster, scallop, spicy tuna, and blue crab. Which would have normally cost 21.75 per person but it was buy 1 set get 1 set free. Salmon and blue crab were good, but scallop and lobster had a lot of mayo and you could pretty much only taste the mayo. Spicy tuna was good, but for 21.75 I feel like you could go to pokkiritto and get something for cheaper. The portions are small and they do 1 roll at a time to pace you out, but we definitely left the restaurant hungry.   For the price and quality I definitely wouldn't go again, but its definitely something you can go to say you've gone.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Mofo A.	Hand rolls are really good and the set menu options provide value.  I like the Go and Shi set.  The beer prices are whacked, $5.75 is overpriced, should be $4-5 at the most.  Services is good and there's never been a wait.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Rammy C.	The wait is worth it. If you're a major sashimi fan and love handrolls this place is amazing. Handrolls come as you finish so that you get them fresh and enjoy the full flavors of the fish and toasted nori. The negi toro, scallops, blue crab and waygu are the best. Order a lot cuz you'll want more.   And chef Brian was so great to us.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tiffanie L.	Pretty comparable to Kazu Nori in LA!  I ordered the Shi (4) and got the Blue Crab, Negi Yellowtail, Spicy Salmon and Bay Scallop. I really enjoyed every hand roll on this set menu. I liked the fact that they added green onion to the yellowtail so it gave the roll a nice crunch. The Blue Crab and Bay Scallop had the perfect amount of mayo and it wasn't overly creamy!   Pricing: A little over $16 for 4 Parking: private lot + street parking	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Maria P.	\"INCREDIBLE with Amazing Fish quality\"  THE BEST HAND-ROLL IN AMERICA.\u00a0 I am a Japanese. I have eaten sushi and sushi hand rolls everywhere in US. Haven't found anything like this!!  \u00a0 This place is just opened and the d\u00e9cor is modern contempo look with some Japanese themed Anime murals on the wall. I definitely dig the edgy look and minimalist feel. The wait staff was very courteous and attentive to my requests.  Now onto the food. Too keep things fresh, the chefs prepare each roll one-by-one, rather than sending them all out at once. The chefs toast seaweed each time with Hibachi (fire bowl) to make it extra crisp. \u00a0  I had salmon Sashimi, Blue Crab, Negi Yellowtail, Maine Lobster, Wagyu Shabu hand rolls .The price is very reasonable.\u00a0  My favorite one was Wagyu Shabu Roll. Shabu-shabu is one of the popular Japanese dishes. The chef boiled the thinly-sliced Wagyu beef in special hot broth to cook it and made hand-roll with it. It was absolutely delicious!!!  I am truly impressed with the quality level of ingredients of fish and meat here. I will definitely come back with my friends next week!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lauren G.	Such a great experience to add to the Convoy area!  Freshly opened, this Temaki Bar really presents high quality ingredients and fresh hand rolls to guests. It's the perfect place for a date or a meaningful catch up with friends or family.  You are seated at a rectangular open bar with the chefs in the center. There's limited seating, so smaller parties definitely will work better - which also helps with the intimate attention you get from the chefs.  The walls have some amazing art to really add to the hip and classy atmosphere.  There are a few preset menus and individual rolls you can order - each with their own special umami to them!   I had the first set on the menu, Sashimi Appetizer, and a Wagyu Beef Hand Roll and was very impressed with the quality.  Highly recommend the savory Sashimi Appetizer! It meltsssssss into your taste buds!  Our servers were very nice and attentive and our chef who presented the hand rolls to us over the counter recommended we eat them quickly to enjoy the full quality and perfected temperatures.  A really great dining experience to try and live the good food life!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kyle C.	Kept the expectations really low walking in but wanted to see if toasted seaweed was really worth it. Seated in the observation booth and started out with the hamachi yellow tail sashimi. Fresh and fatty. The ponzu sauce and jalape\u00f1o over it was really good. Ended up getting the 4 course: blue crab, yellow tail, bay scallop and salmon. Honestly seeing them toast the seaweed and presenting it to you was a one of a kind experience. Not to sound like a effing snob but fuck that was delicious. The rice, with the freshness of the seafood and the crunch of the seaweed. The best hand rolls hands down. A beer, the sashimi and 4 rolls ran me $30. Came 40 minutes after open and not that crowded. Not sure how the wait would be during rush but still pretty good.   This is quality over quantity so I wouldn't expect to get full but who wants to feel like shit after eating high quality sushi.   My chef and another patron found out we were from the 562 as well so the experience of meeting familiar people was nice. Ask for James for your chef!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ryan R.	My girlfriend and I come here often for their happy hour. The main chef here is always friendly and provides us with a great experience that keeps us coming back. The happy hour can leave you with a much cheaper bill while still eating quality hand rolls. I recommend the negi toro hand roll.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Reba G.	The BEST hand rolls I've had. The combo of the cold fish and toasted nori is an epiphany, why hasn't anyone done this before? Also they make the rolls cylindrical vs cone shaped so you get an equal amount of fish and rice in each bite. Everything is so fresh, and the customer service is excellent. Make a reservation and try to go during the least busiest time. We went On a Friday at 1, the parking situation is very tough here, very small lot. They have good lunch specials but I would recommend the set menu.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Marivic R.	Hubby and I really enjoyed their hand rolls, especially the bay scallops! We loved it so much we ended up ordering 3 of the Go set menu each consisting of 5 hand rolls!!! The only complaint I have is how they give you a small amount of their premiun soy sauce and a tiny ball of wasabi (see pic). Throughout the meal, I had to ask for 3 refills (which is a hassle) and yet it was not enough. Finding parking in this place is close to impossible, we're lucky enough to find street parking across the street. But they do have this 2 story parking structure across the street by Jasmine restaurant charging only $1 per hour.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tom L.	Finally a Temaki Bar on convoy!  Short: Slightly pricy fancy sushi   Long: Coming from LA, one of my favorite things to do is to go get \"fancy\" sushi. J / Wata is a new hip place to go on Convoy if you want to experience that.   My favorite thing about this place is that they hand you one roll at a time; you'll get it fresh! I got the Shi which gave me crab, yellowtail, salmon and scallop. As you would expect, the fish was fresh and tasted good, not too chunky and overly chewy.   It is a bit pricy, and honestly value for sushi could be better elsewhere but when you're here you feel a sense of luxury.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Yoav L.	I've been waiting for this place to open for a while. So fresh and so good.  Every single thing in the menu is top notch and won't disappoint.  The only problem I see is that price for lunch per person will be around $30 which is kinda of pricey even tough it's super fresh and tasty.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Joecylin Deean R.	This place is phenomenal.. I found this spot on the Hot \u0026 new so I had to try it out for myself since I am a die hard sushi lover! Upon entering the server seats us \u0026 gives us a run down of how to order things. They have a small simple menu selection so this place is not somewhere to get SUPER full at without spending some moneeeyyy.   Price: honestly for the way the restaurant is set up \u0026 that each hand roll is made 1 at a time after you finish each one I knew it wouldn't be some cheap sushi spot price. My bf and I ordered the set of 5 rolls for $21 which is fair enough for the experience!  \u0026 also 2 ala carte Wagyu Shabu beef ones.  Food: lemme tell you..... each one I ate had so much flavor I was eating it so slow I didn't want it to go away. LOL the order we had was  1.Negi Salmon 2.Bay Scallop  3.Maine Lobster  4. Spicy Toro  5. Blue crab   And we paid an extra $8 for each of us to try the wagyu beef one since there was so many reviews that recommended it. Honestly I would never order a hand roll anywhere else ever again. I love how our chef explained to us their concept.  Made into cylinders instead of traditional cone shape- to ensure equal distribution for the rice and fish!   Made to order ( one at a time to you finish it) - so the rice stays warm, the seaweed stays nice and crisp and the fish doesn't harden up or get warm. All these tips were so helpful and the experience is something to try out! The wagyu beef one topped it all off.. so tender and juicy that I was really about to order another one. We will definitely be back. We didn't eat all day and this actually filled us up! We were at a good full.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Cathy N.	I've been waiting to try a sushi joint that specializes in hand rolls and man, oh man was I completely satisfied!   We came on a Saturday and made reservations for 7:30 PM. We checked in with the hostesses who were extremely friendly and helpful. They also explain the menu/concept once your seated and promptly grab your drinks. The restaurant was full when we got in, but mind you, it is a small space. (I suggest making a reservation through Yelp!) The seating arrangement is in the form of a U-shaped bar so the chefs can easily make the rolls for you and the parties around you. The ambiance is like any other sushi restaurant and the sushi chefs try to communicate with you as much as they can, considering they are busy making rolls.  You can order sets here that come in 3, 4, or 5 rolls. There is an a la carte menu and a small appetizer menu as well. I ordered the Go set which comes with 5 rolls. My favorite is probably the Maine lobster roll and salmon. It was so delish! They toast the nori right in front of you which makes it perfectly crisp and helps with the chewiness when you take a bite. They give you one at a time and suggests that you eat it right away.   The prices are pretty fair. A set of 5 rolls cost $21 and a la carte prices are around $4-$8 depending on what you want. Overall, if I'm ever back in the area again I will definitely pay this place another visit!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Haley L.	My husband and I went yesterday for dinner after finding this place on Yelp. We had an incredible experience! The service was great, and all the food we tried was delicious. Our favorites were the waygu, toro and lobster. I like how they toast the seaweed to add a crunch when you eat. They also give you one hand roll at a time to make sure when you're eating it, it doesn't get soggy. We also had the sake sampler. They said they are partnering with a sake brewery and will have sake on tap soon as well as events. We will be back :)	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Joel P.	A great place for a casual lunch with great food and service. Went there on a date and it was a great experience we both enjoyed it very much we felt comfortable the entire time and the food was fantastic.If you don't know what to order ask the chef to make something up, it worked out wonderfully for me.!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Diane J.	This place incredible. And is truly an experience.  What: One of a kind hand rolls that are served fresh, one-by-one. You east as you receive. This is not a quick, fast food place, and honestly, I like that about it. However, I would advise that this is not the best place to go if you're starving and need a lot of food right away. Where: A tiny space in Convoy next to Raki Raki Ramen and Tapioca Express. It's bar seating and not huge. Parking in this plaza is kind of a disaster, but we went on a Sunday afternoon and there wasn't a huge wait. Food: I had the Spicy Salmon, Hamachi Golden Ratio Tare, Blue Crab, Negi Toro, and Bay Scallop. This is also the order I would rank them in. The fish was all incredibly fresh and nori crips. The only downside I found was that the scallops are cold (I like hot food) and there was too much spicy mayo for me (this is a personal choice, my brother quite enjoyed it).    All in all, it was such a fun place and experience. I can't wait to go back.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Zinuo X.	Great experience! Went there alone and ordered a set and two other hand rolls. The salmon sashimi is fresh, and it came with soy sauce already brushed on the fish (which I really like). The uni roll and blue crab roll are the best I've tried.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Teeeforfour C.	First time dining here. Really enjoyed the freshness  of the fish and the toasted nori!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Brian T.	Hand roll sushi bar in San Diego.  It's done in the same vein as Kazunori in LA.  Executed at a fairly high level.  Premium ingredients, crisp seaweed, and fairly consistent ratios of rice and proteins.  My favorite is the negi salmon.  I order multiples every time I go.  Bay scallop, blue crab, and lobster hand rolls high quality as well.  Spicy rolls are good.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Mike C.	I was in town for a quick day business trip and decided to stop in for dinner. This place looks modern from the outside with the wood trim. Inside, the mural reminds me of \"Kill Bill\" for some reason.   Nice and cozy and we had the counter seats. I was driving all day so I worked up an appetite. You just fill out the menu card and the roll starts coming on. Started off with some hand rolls and sashimi which was amazing. The fish tastes really fresh and rice just right.   I was still hungry so ordered the Waygu roll. Totally amazing and melts in your mouth good! The flavor was just something to be experienced. I am glad my friend recomended this place. Would definitely come back next time in town.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Andrea Q.	Ok this place is REALLY good.  It's a one of a kind experience, the rolls are served one by one and the chef advises you to eat it right away, as it is the best way to enjoy the flavor.  This place serves Temaki rolls, so don't expect your regular california roll or anything along that line. The pictures listed in here definitely do not make justice to the flavor of the rolls. Believe me when I say I'll definitely be coming back.  The seaweed is toasted, so eating it right away gives you a crunchy taste.. If you wait too long, the seaweed looses its crunchiness. I got a 4 pc set menu, and even though at first I thought it was not gonna be enough food, I was completely satisfied!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Gina L.	They were extremely accommodating of my dietary needs. In fact, they asked about them before we even ordered. The temaki was outstanding. Will be back again soon!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Helen H.	WOW. I didn't realize what I was missing out on until I ate the hand rolls here.   The seaweed is freshly toasted...roasted...? It gives it this nice crunch and really brings out the flavor of the seaweed. From looking at the pictures, I thought these rolls looked pretty basic, but I was so wrong. They're full of flavor and pleasant textures. It's made fresh before your eyes and really brings in that excitement when you know you're moments away from getting your next mouth-watering hand roll. Make sure you take that first bite right away to know what I mean when I rave about the seaweed!   I tried their \"Go\" set which includes 5 hand rolls so that I can try a variety of rolls for a better deal. I was pleasantly stuffed by the end of it. Next time I'll go a la carte for rolls that I really want (uni, ikura, uni+ikura, wagyu, unagi) that may not be included in their set menu.   Overall great experience sitting at the bar with my S/O. The chefs and staff were very friendly, needless to say I'll be back over and over again!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Caroline M.	You walk in and you immediately feel as though you belong to some sort of secret club. But you won't find a slither of arrogance. We were seated, our orders were taken, and ten minutes later we had a beautiful roll directly put in our hand. Fresh fish...simplicity... I'll take it... Thank you for the fantastic experience, kindness and welcoming spirits.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	David L.	3.43 stars. Its decent, but not for enough that I want to round up to 4 stars. I think if you've had KazuNori in LA before, this experience will fall short. But if you haven't, it should be fine. The fish is fresh enough and the seaweed is toasted, which is unique. The rolls aren't very filling though and the wait time is a little ridiculous. The second time I went, it was an hour wait. Totally not worth it, so I went around the corner for a sushi burrito instead. Twice as filling, half the price, and zero wait. I'd wait maybe 25 minutes for this place tops. Even then, I don't think I'd pay the $20 some dollars for the set menus. It's missing something, I just can't place it.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Christine T.	My family wanted to go here while they were visiting me a few weeks ago because there aren't any good hand roll bars in OC. We ordered the Go set menu as well as the waygu shabu and uni hand rolls. Everything was delicious and fresh. They even have real wasabi which is a major plus!   Parking can kind of be crazy in this plaza like many places on Convoy.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jasmine P.	This place is amazing! I just wish the pricing was a little cheaper! I feel like more people would go as well! I'm still hungry after!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Adrienne V.	I'm definitely one that likes a lot of choices but the simplicity of their menu does not take away from the delicious quality of their food. It's not your typical sushi spot with a ton of different rolls and as I'm sure you know by now, they specialize in Temaki aka hand rolls. I still enjoy crazy over the top rolls from time to time but I feel like with sushi, the simpler the better so that you can really taste and appreciate the ingredients. You can order in \"sets\" or a la carte depending on whatever suits your palate. Each handroll is made to order and they make one at a time for you, which are meant to be enjoyed RIGHT AWAY. It's really cool because they toast up your seaweed so it has that roasted flavor and gets crispy and roll them up as you go. I got the Go set which came with: blue crab, spicy toro, negi salmon, bay scallop \u0026 Maine lobster (although not in that order.) All of them were really good but blue crab was my absolute favorite. I had a bite of the unagi too which had a big piece of flavorful unagi. We also shared the hamachi sashimi in which you could also taste the freshness and quality just like everything else. My onlyyy gripe is that the hand rolls are a little small and while I left at a satisfied full (meaning I still had room for Somi Somi after haha) the guys were still hungry. Super cool experience though and will definitely be recommending them to all my friends!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Collin M.	An amazing experience highlighted by phenomenal fresh food, prepared in a traditional setting and manner that give you a intimate experience with this fun personal staff	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Dana H.	I have been here 3x.   Decent sushi bar can do some work in improving service. Timing of when items are served are off - this is a casual bar style restaurant so timing should be the most important aspect of service outside of food.  I know the employees try very hard but if I got my hand rolls before my salad, then there's a problem. Overall, food tastes fine - I like that they warm their rice but flavors (especially rice) can be slightly more pronounced and proportions can be done better - negi to toro ratio was off (needs a bit more negi to balance evenly).   Lighting can be improved to make the dinner experience less \"cafeteria\". Additional hand roll chefs would help, too. Really want this place to do well since the staff is friendly but management can look into the above issues to make the improvements that will really make this place shine.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Julie B.	Came in for their grand opening which they offered a BOGO deal! It was a very unique dining experience. Upon arriving, our waiter sat us and explained how the dining experienced worked. They give you a order menu in which you check what you would like to order and then they give it to the chef. My boyfriend and I both ordered the \"GO\" set which includes 5 handrolls. ( Maine lobster, spicy tuna, bay scallops, negi salmon, blue crab). The Maine lobster and bay scallops were my favorite. The spicy tuna and negi salmon were pretty mediocre and the blue crab had to be my least favorite. Tasted straight up like mayo. They also had a premium soy sauce but recommended to dip only alittle so it wouldn't overpower the taste of the handroll.  I love how they flame roast the nori which gives it a crispy texture. You get one handroll at a time, so once you've got your handroll, the chef is making another handroll for another customer. There were about 25 seats in the restaurant with 2 chefs on each side of the bar. The total time it took from start to finish was about 45mins for 5 handrolls. Overall, the experience was great, the staff was nice and attentive. It's a little pricey for everyday eat, but definitely nice for an occasion or once in awhile! Also parking sucks to be sure to come early.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Monica M.	Wow. Had an amazing meal with amazing service. Ian, our waiter, was so attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended some of my FAVORITES including the hamachi hand roll, waygu hand roll, and soft shell crab hand roll. Not to mention, we tried the semi dry sake and it was bomb! Would definitely recommend for a unique experience and great vibes. Thanks Ian!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sherilyn R.	For everyone wondering if this place is as good as Kazunori in LA - it is. Maybe even a little better.  I got the \"Shi\" set which comes with 4 hand rolls, and I added a Negi Toro. Five rolls had me satisfied, but I got one more Blue Crab roll and I was STUFFED. The quality of their seafood is on point, but what really makes it is the seaweed and the rice. Make sure you bite into the hand roll right away to fully experience the extremely crisp nori!  On top of their hand rolls, this place makes sure their ginger and wasabi is high quality, too. The wasabi isn't your typical wasabi out of the tube. It has actual flavor, depth, and texture. I loved it so much I got extra!  I'm glad I've found my favorite place for hand rolls in San Diego. The delicious hand rolls and friendly customer service will keep me coming back for sure.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Cindy T.	This was such a nice place! A co-worker and I went on the Friday before the Grand Opening and I tried the Go (5). This experience was really interesting because there is a chef in the center of the restaurant making your rolls as you eat them. They hand them directly into your hands and makes them on the spot! My favorite roll was the Bay Scallop, which was so fresh with the warm sushi rice and mixed in some kind of mayo sauce. Every roll is light and refreshing. I would say 5 was just enough to feel satisfied and not bloated.   The menu is set and be careful if you have seafood allergies. The restaurant is a bit small and has maybe about 15-20 seats around in a bar setting!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jen T.	I have been coming to this place way too much. I am a bit obsessed with it though.  I love the simplicity of J Wata. They do strictly hand rolls with 1 or 2 sashimi specials.   I have eaten almost every single type here. If you are new, try one of their pre set menus. They give you a great variety and pricing is slightly better than just ordering a la carte.   My favorites are: Blue Crab Spicy Toro Negi Salmon  The chef will hand you each roll one by one with the intention of you eating it right away to preserve the crispness of the nori with each bite. They only have counter seating for about 20ish people, so it may be difficult to come with a big group or with small children. I have taken my 3 year old daughter here and she does well as she loves sushi/sashimi.   A great addition to SD food scene as it is unique. Parking is a nightmare but worth it. I come here and then head over to Cauldron for dessert.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Johnathan C.	This is a fantastic sushi bar. The chic decor and comfortable seats greet patrons as they enter, and the menu provides options for dedicated sushi diners as well as vegetarian friends. The wait staff takes orders and attentively serves throughout the meal. The chefs present hand rolls one by one, all carefully prepared and deliciously flavored. Each roll has a uniquely wonderful taste that is elevated by its warm rice and flame-crisped nori. To eat here is to know delicious sushi.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Gina B.	I got 2 Negri Salmon and a Negri Toro..each made and handed to me one at a time.. wow.. these are way yummier than any other place.. they sear the nori (seaweed) so it's crisp.. then they create the perfect size roll for easy eating. The fish was divine and the sushi rice perfection..this exceeded my expectations. I equate it to eating in Italy where they use very few but quite exceptional ingredients. The service was spot on as well.. this is a perfect place to start with a lil something as u wait for your table at Raki Raki Ramen	
J Wata Temaki Bar	J T.	Amazing. The quality is outstanding. They really take take the time to ensure that the food is up to the highest standards. So much so, that they won't make the hand rolls to go since it wouldn't taste as good straight from the chef. I respect that. Too many restaurants are out to make a profit from crappy food. I'm thrilled that J Wata elevates their food to the next level. I'll be back time and again!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lora B.	The concept behind this 24-seat bar are premium handrolls! The menu is small but that is because each handroll is made right in front of you and served personally by the chef. The chef waits until you have finished eating your current roll before making the next one. My husband and I were able to dine in on one of the Grand Opening weekends.  They have been opened for about a month and the word has gotten out.  We came right at 11 am and had no problem getting a seat. When we left 55 minutes later, there was a line.  All of the staff we interacted with were very friendly, made us feel welcome and answered any questions I had. One novelty of this place is that they roast each seaweed on top of a charcoal open flame to get it toasty. You can hear the crunch when you take a bite. I really enjoyed the texture of the nori! They give you a disposable wet towel to wipe your hands with when you sit down. Even though there were chopsticks available, I just used my hands! The usual cone-shaped hand rolls hold everything at the bottom, but these were open ended rolls, so if you are prone to being clumsy like me, you had to be careful because the filling easily came out once you were near the end of the roll.  We chose the Go set that came with 5 rolls.  There are no substitutions and no splitting plates.The rolls are about five inches long packed with simple ingredients.We started with the Maine Lobster roll. It was packed with a lot of lobster meat! Delicious! The next roll was the Spicy Tuna roll. It was great, but we're used to eating this sushi so it didn't make that big of an impression. The third roll was a Bay Scallop roll. This was one of my favorites! You can taste the freshness of the seafood and the mayo ratio was just right! The fourth roll was a Negi Salmon roll.   Again, one of our regular sushi rolls. It was also good. The last roll was the Blue Crab roll.  It was heavenly! The sweetness of the crab melted in my mouth! This was very yummy. One might think four or five rolls doesn't make for a filling meal, but when you take the time to savor each one and patiently wait for the next while having good conversation, I was satisfied! This also leaves some room for dessert. The receipt offered a 15% off a same day purchase at the Angels and Hearts creperie next door. Yogurt World and the newly opened Cauldron are a few doors down as well.  The atmosphere is like an open exhibition kitchen with interesting art on the walls.  Initially there was only one Chef working while Chef Brian was still prepping. But once the place filled up,  Chef Brian jumped in to start filling the orders. I'm glad too because I wanted some \"sushi chef\" talk and got the chance to banter with Chef Brian. That's part of the sushi bar experience, right? If you like seafood, I think you will enjoy this place. I have never ordered a lobster, scallops or blue crab roll at other places because of the price, but this set of five rolls was $21.75 and worth it. Ok, I mainly gave some positives right? So here's some negatives: -Parking in this strip mall can be like the Hunger Games so be prepared! I don't really count this against the restaurant though.  Maybe Chef Watanabe can invest in a parking garage nearby since he owns a lot of the places? -The water came with no ice.  I like ice. We had to request for some ice when it came time to refill. But again, our server was very nice (and nice-looking too, hehehe).  -Here's the one thing that was off-putting. The Chefs are gloved up making the rolls but then they are also touching tablets with the same hands checking on what to make next.  Does this only bother me thinking about yucky germs being spread? Not sure how to fix that.  Chef Brian was using his pinky finger to swipe on his device, but I'm certain his pinky also touches the mound of rice whenever he grabs some for his next roll and so on. Whatever. I guess I've seen worse. Overall for the taste, friendly staff and concept, 4 stars!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Omid F.	Ordered the Hamachi Kama appetizer and received it well after we were done with our food. Don't call something that takes 45 minutes to make an appetizer especially if you are going to serve it to your customers after they are done with their food, that ultimately makes it a dessert!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Amanda C.	Overall experience is just okie. Coming from LA we are very blessed to have Kazu Nori. Therefore when compared I would still pick Kazu Nori.   Freshness of the fish is very good. However I think the lobster and the crab marination could be changed. I can definitely taste the wateriness residue from the protein. Maybe they need to squeeze out the excess water before mixing their mayo and seasoning.   I did not like the part where we can not take out the spicy option from the set menu. Some people may prefer non spicy.   Also the order of how the fish is presented is very random. I think it would be better if they presented the fish according to light to heavy. I started with lobster which I think messes up the taste palette. So maybe start with toro, salmon, scallops, crab, lobster.   They heated the seaweed which was interesting. I would definitely give it another chance granted it just opened. And there is nothing like this in SD.   If ever the chef/owner can try Kazu Nori in LA. I would definitely recommend so they can get some inspiration.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Cid I.	Actual rating: ** 3.5 stars  (since yelp doesn't allow half stars)  Having tried Kazunori in LA and be an avid fanatic of the place, I was curious of J Wata ever since I caught wind of it on Eater. Still on their soft opening, there are a handful of things they can still improve on and hopefully they will. Of course, I have a great feeling that J Wata will constantly be compared to Kazunori for those who have had the pleasure of experiencing both. That being said, the food and service were quite alright given that they are still getting things situated. I still have to say my review greatly compares my experience at J Wata against Kazunori, glossing over some aspects and concentrating on others.  Layout: The layout of both eateries are the same. Limited seats surrounding the chefs. I want to say that the number available seats are similar, but the number of chefs serving are lesser at J Wata. The art on the walls was definitely cool though, depicting a Japanese style anime biker gang with one side having a red bike - reminding me greatly of Akira.  Service:  If memory serves me right, a huge difference is that there are more chefs serving you at Kazunori. I recall having to wait maybe a minute or two tops after finishing my handroll to receive another at Kazunori even when it was jam packed. During my visit to J Wata, the place was half full and had two chefs working the booths. The chefs were working as best they could, but could not keep up with how fast a person might take to eat their roll. I definitely waited a bit after finishing each one. I would hope and suggest that a third chef is brought in once the soft opening is over with.   I do have to point out that the order tracking devices they were using were malfunctioning a bit so that could have added to the delay. As for the chef himself and the wait staff, they were all quite polite and relatively attentive. Nothing bad to say there.   Price: I was a little disappointed in this category. Kazunori definitely has this point beat as the hand rolls there are noticeably cheaper by set and per roll. As it stands, the pricing at J Wata makes me hesitate returning... at least not as much as I visit Kazunori.   Food:  Now here is the part I have to emphasize that I am REALLY comparing this place to Kazunori. It's hard to ignore that J Wata probably takes after Kazunori. The ordering system is the same where you can order hand rolls a-la-carte or as a set. I got a set and ordered something on the side.   The nori is toasted per roll in order to have them crisp and break apart when you bite into it. Personally, I feel like this wasn't executed perfectly because the center of the nori of each roll I had was chewy, causing the filling (fish and rice) to fall out on the other end. The ends were fine but the center was the problematic point. Kazunori has this down and I don't recall ever having to struggle on any of my visits.  The rice was good, standardly seasoned as any other sushi restaurant. Even so, there is a stark difference as Kazunori and the Nozawa shops distinctly season their rice. I could taste the difference between the rolls of J Wata and Kazunori. You'd have to try Kazunori or Nozawa to know what I am referring to. By preference, I prefer Kazunori's seasoning more because it allowed me to enjoy the roll without using soy sauce.  The fish was definitely fresh. Nothing was fishy so I very much enjoyed that. I ordered the 4 set, which included  blue crab, negi yellowtail, spicy salmon, and bay scallops. They were all good and seasoned decently, but I can't say they were great or amazing. Again by preference, I feel that Kazunori wins out again in this category. Both places, the fish was was unmistakably fresh, but Kazunori just adds something else more to the fish to amplify the flavor. My favorite at Kazunori, the blue crab, was a bit more muted at J Wata. For every roll following it, the same sentiment was had.  Overall, J Wata is not a bad place. Despite me making it sound like they are a mess, it's good. It's just that, in my opinion, it has very big shoes to fill if they are actually modeling themselves after Kazunori. There's good reason that Kazunori and Nozawa constantly has lines out the door. I just truly hope that J Wata works it out or establishes itself to be a real contender in the future once the dust has settled.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Alexa O.	Best Temaki I've had. The fish was fresh, the seaweed was warm \u0026 not dry, the rice was warm \u0026 not dry. Highly recommend! I tried the negi salmon, spicy salmon, unagi (eel) my personal favorite, yellowtail, Maine lobster, scallops, spicy tuna \u0026 all were amazing!   I'd only come here solo or with 1 other person, definitely not good for children.  The place is super small \u0026 only seats a handful around 1 entire table/bar in the whole place. Food comes out 1 item you order at a time, it's nice to pace yourself \u0026 really enjoy it.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lopez M.	This is already a hot spot and it hasn't even officially opened yet.  I went with a few foodie friends and they all said this is the best they've had. From the raw wasabi to the rolls ...and that yellowtail collar! A must.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	jun l.	Straight out of swanky harajuku!  The space is absolutely stunning.  With the chefs hand rolling each order in the center its a culinary performance that pleases the eyes and appetite.  The edgy murals remind me of the street scenes of young rebels on the Tokyo streets.  As Unapologetically irreverent as Japan generally is apologetically reverent.  The urban vibe combined with the clean lines of this Temaki bar is also reflected in the food.   Leave your past experiences with the typical handroll at the door.   The jwata handroll is wrapped In sumptuous Nori hand warmed on an open flame in front of you.  Yes, hand - warmed - on an open flame !  The Sushi rice is light , fluffy , and delicately seasoned.  The fish is supple, rich , and infused with some kind of essential sauces ?  What can be better ?  The Wagyu beef swish, swished Shabu Shabu style.  What can I say.  Arigato!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Zara M.	The sushi chefs are just fantastic, service is excellent. Cool look inside the restaurant. I couldn't ask for a better experience. The artistry and quality of the ingredients are both top-notch. I have celiac disease and they easily accommodated my needs.  I am already looking forward to going back.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	sar a.	Basically all they serve is hand rolls. They're not bad but the ambience is weird and doesn't feel authentic watching this young kid making it in front of me. Overall awkward service with not much authenticity.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kimberly M.	I've been to a place called KazuNori in LA with the same concept...  just hand rolls so to my surprise they had open a place in SD with the same concept I wanted to try right away! My friend and I visited during their soft opening and luckily after the lunch rush hour. The rolls were delicious. The fish was super fresh and the rice was tasty! I will definitely be back and will the spread the word!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	John H.	It was my first night in SD and my plan was to just jump between a bunch of different restaurants--J Wata being the very first. On my flight out of SD, though all the restaurants I had hopped around to were great, J Wata just stayed on my mind and I would definitely go back to try everything on the menu.   Reading other reviews, you'll quickly find out the format of this place: you select what you want on a piece, pass it to a server, and the server will pass it to the chef (who is right in front of you). He'll make each roll in your order one by one, meticulously toasting the seaweed over an small, open flame while parsing through what you and everyone else has ordered on a tablet. Once the seaweed is toasted and he assembles the hand roll, he'll pass it directly to your hands for you to consume.  I only had a few hand rolls and a miso soup but every single bite I had was so amazing. I wasn't even able to take any pictures because waiting any longer than 30 seconds made the nori less and less crisp and you really have to have the roll go from the chef right to your mouth. The rice was great and the seafood was incredibly fresh.  Another great thing about this format is that, as a guest, you do not have to wait long before you get your first bite. The chef rotates making rolls between guests so everyone is satisfied. In some sort of way, it's good that you have to wait because you spread out your experience and are able to enjoy eat bite on its own, letting the flavors in your mouth truly sink in before haphazardly moving onto your next piece.  My only issue is that each roll is fairly expensive--about $4-7 each from what I remember--but it is really worth it and I would not mind splurging here once in a while if I was a local.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Daniel P.	Sad to say I had to lower the score from five stars to two stars because today I tried to eat lunch at J Wata but there was only one sushi chef serving and preparing for everyone at the bar and it was busy, which meant extremely slow service, a long wait in between cones, and on a weekday at lunch peek hour I just didn't have the time to wait for their extremely slow pace. The other day when I reviewed with five stars, the chef told me they were struggling to bring clients in, and they didn't know until when they would remain open. My question is: how do you expect to keep your customers if you cannot provide for them a good and quick lunch service on a busy weekday? If you cannot have two sushi chefs when it is most busy, then you are hurting your own business, no matter how delicious your food is. I for one will not return to J Wata ever again on a weekday, total waste of my time!   J Wata has the freshest and most delicious Temakis (cones) EVER! If you love sushi and have not been here you have yet to try the best of the best. Amazing quality of products, fantastic service, pure deliciousness. I am a fan! If I lived closer I would eat here every other day. I so wish they would open in North County! J Wata is the best!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	d r.	My friend and I both ordered the GO plus their Hamachi special. We both agreed that they should've served the items in reverse order because it started off sooo great and then gradually declined in flavor with each new roll.   The lobster roll was the best. Spicy tuna was our 2nd favorite. The salmon was good but on the bland side. The bay scallops and blue crab had too much mayonnaise. It actually made the crab taste like canned tuna and I couldn't even taste the scallops. Lastly, the special Hamachi roll with diced raw jalape\u00f1os was disappointing. We love jalape\u00f1os and spicy food, but these jalape\u00f1os were tasteless. There was no spice or even jalape\u00f1o flavor. Even the crunch of these jalape\u00f1os didn't seem to compliment the roll. They were just in the way so I ended up scraping most of it out of mine. I would've ordered another lobster roll, but at $7+ for a la cart, I decided to just get the check.   The super cool wall murals were painted by an artist from LA. One of the servers told me the artist's name, but I forgot.   Service was excellent and the price would've been fine had all the rolls tasted consistently good. Overall, we'd go back to try the other rolls but we're not in a hurry to.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sonny A.	such a great place. not for the non experienced i would fairly say. great rolls. great prices. friendly staff. finally a place that gets it. I had my Bday dinner here tonight with my wife. such a great experience. fight that parking and get eating	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Silvia L.	Its an unique and pleasant dining experience. It definitely is on the pricey side, which is why I am glad I was able to use the BOGO deal they had for their grand opening. The staff were attentive and the chef was able to deliver each hand roll at a good pace. I like the pacing since it gives us time to enjoy and savor the taste in each and every bite. Enjoyable but probably not a place that will fill you up.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Melanie C.	I'm writing this review as I finish the last bite of my Hamachi Golden-ratio Tare.   The hand rolls here are incredible. So fresh tasting. I got the negi yellowtail, Hamachi golden ratio tare (as stated above), the uni, and the wagyu shabu. I have to say the uni was so clean and wasn't extremely briney. The wagyu also melted in your mouth. I highly recommend you eat the rolls immediately as they are handed to you, or you won't be able enjoy the full experience of the roll. They also toast the nori so that adds another incredible element to the roll. I can really appreciate the simplicity of the hand rolls as it allows the fish or meat being served to really shine. I have been searching for a truly authentic Japanese sushi experience since we moved here in January and I've finally found it! I can't stand those rolls drowning in sauce and inauthentic sushi ingredients. Thank you all for an amazing dining experience! I definitely will be back!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Sachin D.	I went here with a few friends the other night. Being a vegetarian, I wasn't too sure what to expect but did see that they had a few options on the menu. The restaurant is very stylish and all seating is bar style. The staff is extremely attentive and each seat comes ready with wasabi and fresh ginger. The menu is simple, high-quality hand rolls. Ideally, one would order one of three set menus that vary in size from 3 to 5 hand rolls. I ordered a la carte since I was getting the vegetarian options.   I ordered three hand rolls: mayo avocado, shiitake mushroom, and a Japanese root vegetable one (the name I cannot recall) with shisho. All are made to order, and one at a time. They were all delicious. The manager or owner also said I hard to try the last vegetarian option which was a fresh ginger and shisho hand roll, it was very refreshing and ON THE HOUSE.   My friends ordered the 3 or 4 temaki hand roll sets and they loved them.   Overall, a nice, unique place that is taking the time to do simple food extremely well.   Definitely would go back here.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kevin D.	Great new spot! The contrast of flavored from the sticky rice, fish, and fresh crunchy nori. My favorites: hamachi (yellowtail), and blue crab	
J Wata Temaki Bar	D U.	The concept is promising but the food and service is lackluster. We came in on a Sunday afternoon with only 3 other patrons in the restaurant. The server took our initial order but forgot our water so we had to remind her. We received our appetizers along with the first hand roll within a reasonable amount of time. We ordered a la carte in small orders (1 or 2 temaki at a time). Our second order took much longer than it should have because the chef and other staff were talking around a laptop near the front door for at least 15 minutes. Also, for our final order, we received only 1 of the 2 temaki's so we had to remind the chef. The sushi rice and toasted seaweed were flavorful and enjoyable, but the fish was average, and served in very small portions. The wagyu beef roll was very disappointing; it was 2 small slices of wagyu beef with rice which was very plain tasting. Even at the happy hour price it's not a good deal. The appetizers were also very small portions. At best, this place is suited for happy hour; but even then you may leave feeling unsatisfied and craving bigger portions of sushi.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Seth S.	This place used to be amazing.  I went today for lunch and half the items weren't available.  Seems to me that if they aren't going out of business they would have more supply.  Disappointing because the food was really good.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Patrick C.	J Wata is a refreshingly authentic Temaki experience, the quality of the fish was incredible and the atmosphere was intimate and fun. Ian was an incredibly knowledgeable and delightful server who made some really helpful recommendations and offered great insight, he pointed us in the direction of the soft shell crab roll which ended up being the highlight of the evening. You know it was a great experience when you start planning your next visit as you walk out of the restaurant. Also special shout out to the sake menu (our boy ian helped us pick the best bottle) and the salmon tower appetizer, this place is legit.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jenny G.	Disclaimer: I LOVE handrolls so couldn't wait to try this place. The fish is indeed fresh, and the warmed/toasted nori is a very nice touch. However I felt the value was lacking for what you get. Limiting factors include: a predominately handroll menu so maybe not enough a selection to sustain a business in this area. They also don't do to go orders so you cannot share the goodness with anyone unless they actually come to the joint. The parking is the worst too, so that alone almost makes it not worth coming back to.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Janet K.	Nothing spectacular about this place. My boyfriend and I LOVE sushi so we definitely wanted to check out this restaurant. The price is pretty expensive for what it is. We got a course of 6 maki rolls for almost $30 per course. We only received 5 of the rolls and asked where the 6th one was. The chef swore he gave us all of them but we never received the toro roll. He gave it to us in the end and we definitely have not had it. He confused the salmon roll he gave us for the toro. The fact that he made us feel pretty bad for reminding him totally threw me off. It's a shame because the maki was pretty fresh and delicious. However, I'm definitely not coming back.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Giselle B.	New cool spot on Convoy by the owners of Pokirrito. I must say its basically a sugarfish ( LA Sushi Spot) but in San Diego. The customer service is fantastic but the hand rolls are good. Nothing was RIDICULOUS AMAZING. It was just good. Its very traditional Japanese, not what we are used to in San Diego; the spicy creamy sauces etc. I can come back but definitely a bigger fan of Hane.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Drew C.	Delicious and hip. The quality of the rolls is outstanding. They put a great deal of effort into making each roll by hand and make sure it comes out perfect each time. The service was outstanding too, whenever we needed anything they were able to provide it quickly. I was very surprised of the price for the quality, you're definitely getting your money's worth here.   I recommend coming to try it out. This is going to become a very popular place in San Diego.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Chloe Y.	Food and service were good. Taking out 2stars because of over priced. I have been there twice but not sure if I would go there again.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Roger D.	I tried this place for dinner while visiting San Diego from Orange County last week. Great food. Fun vibe. Friendly staff. The rolls are handmade and delicious. Overall, I loved my first visit to J Wata. It will definitely be on my go-to list anytime I'm in San Diego.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Alan D.	Awesome place. My girlfriend has celiac's and has to do gluten-free (GF). They were very, very attentive to that and made sure to highlight the items in the menu that were gluten free. They also have gluten free soy sauce.  The hand rolls were EXCELLENT. I loved the negi salmon, bay scallops, and the Maine lobster. The blue crab hand roll was extremely fresh and amazing. The seaweed was wonderfully crispy, the rice was good, and the fish was fresh.  This was their soft opening so I don't know what it will be like after the grand opening. I would suggest a more  sake selection, but that's my only complaint. I loved the casual bar setting, fast service, and great service.  Update: They had a highlighted menu up front for the servers to reference so they knew what was gluten free. The manager remembered my girlfriend and I from our last visit and he told us about some of the recipe changes they made, including changing the mayo they use so the hand rolls (blue crab, Maine lobster, bay scallop) were GF now. Awesome that they were willing to make that accommodation we appreciated that they remembered us.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tracy T.	This place is awesome. Quality ingredients, very friendly and attentive staff. We love James! He is always so welcoming and helpful!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Stefanie H.	Cannot say enough good things about my first experience dining here. All of the food was extremely fresh and flavorful. The staff were attentive and friendly. The time spaced out between each handroll is perfect enough to thoroughly enjoy each different one. My personal favorite was the bay scallop. Highly recommend coming for both the food and experience!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Erin K.	Came in for J Wata's soft opening, and I was delighted by what a unique dining experience it is! I was only used to eating temaki in the cone shape. The chef, James, was really friendly and explained that the round/cylinder shape allows for better distribution of ingredients. The fish was very tender and flavorful, and the hand rolls felt delicately and carefully put together.   It's pricey for everyday dining, but definitely an experience to see the nori flame-roasted and to taste hand rolls straight from the chefs. I would totally come again for a special occasion or when I want to impress someone with how refined my tastes are.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Vanessa C.	Awesome and fun! This is my first time getting the hand roll experience at the bar. I've been to plenty of sushi bars and this felt very similar! It is currently still in soft opening, so the menu suggestion is pretty limited. They have different \"sets\" available which makes it easy to choose if you want 3, 4, or 5 rolls. I'm a picky eater so I have been ordering hand rolls a la carte, which costs more. Oops!   Spicy Toro 10/10 - Yum! Its so buttery and melts in your mouth.  Spicy Tuna 9/10 - Still good, but prefer the fatty tuna!  Blue Crab 8/10 - Its very good but I just don't love crab all that much. This hand roll is in most of the set menus.   They toast the seaweed so its warm, the fish inside is chilled. Eat it fast, after taking a quick picture of course.   Overall its a very simple place. There's hand rolls, a couple of sashimi plates, and that's about it. I love that about it. Good atmosphere. In and out kinda of place. Actually that would depend. If there's only one chef and more packed, the wait between rolls may take a while. I've been where I was stuffing the hand rolls because there was no other customers and also a little bit too long of a wait between.   Can't wait to see grand opening menu!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Nawal S.	An amazing and unique dining experience in San Diego. The chef hands you each roll perfectly timed (very similar to KazuNori in LA but a more comfy experience). It's an exceptionally efficient process that amazes me. I have been here three times and each time has been fantastic. The mix of the rice with the warm crispy nori that you literally see them heat up in front of you is an amazing combo with the delightful melt in your mouth fish. I haven't strayed too far from the fixed sets but have really enjoyed the 4 and 5 piece set. My favorites include the toro, golden ratio hamachi, and blue crab. I would strongly disagree with complaints about value given the quality of the product. It's also a pleasant experience with super cool decor and really nice service.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	M O.	Nothing special in this restaurant. I am guessing it will remain in soft opening until it eventually closes. Parking situation is terrible in that area to begin with.   I ordered some salmon and hamachi appetizers; they looked like some scrap leftovers when a fish is filleted. Not sure of the taste with that sauce whatever it was.  Menu - not whole lot of choices.  Their \"signature\" offering is the seaweed roll.  Roasted seaweed wrap - really?  Any restaurant can do that!  Only good thing - place is newly renovated.  I don't mind spending money in authentic Japanese restaurant and quality food in the $100 range per diner in restaurants like Ikiru, Sushi Ota in San Diego and Wafu in Oramge County. But in this place - NO!  Don't waste your money here!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Myungja K.	It was new dining experience. Never seen anything like this even in Japan! You should go, experience it yourself. Taste? Of course very good. This is a total package! Myungja	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Joanna W.	Really good food in a fun unique atmosphere. Some of the mixtures of fish and sauce like mayo n scallops were more 4 star but that was when they opened so probably have tightened up since. Its fun to go here. Its a little more $ than other places but worth the extra cost.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Connor P.	Sushi was supah good and yumm,, and the sushi maker / waitress were friendly, kind and personal. Love this place, and will come back. The sake is good 2!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Chalmer D.	First timer with a party of 3 and it was a great experience. Very solid hand rolls, especially the blue crab. Very cool artwork on the sides on the restaurant. I enjoyed talking to the chefs at work as they prep fresh fish in front of you.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Owie P.	One of the best Temaki bars I've been to. The chefs actually talk to you to have a conversation which is always a plus. I mean, that's sorta why you go up to the bar seat, to have a more intimate time between your food and how it's made. My top faves were the negi salmon and the blue crab. V fresh on ya mommas! I can't help it drool while I'm writing this. If you like the poke shop next door, I'm sure you'll love this!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Alex V.	Had to give this place a try since I'm a sucker for handrolls. First impression, the place is kinda small with a U-shaped bar that sits around 20 people. It allows the chefs to interact with their customers which makes the experience much more interesting. The handroll is served 1 at a time directly to your hand to ensure freshness. The rolls are simple yet full of flavor - crispy seaweed wrap, well seasoned rice, good quality fish and a hint of a herb or other flavor depends on the roll.  I got the SAN combo with uni and unagi added.  All of them were really good. My favorite would be the blue crab and uni. They both have a very rich and delicate flavor. I totally recommend this place to anyone who appreciates a delicate yet satisfying Japanese flavor.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kat T.	I went here during their soft opening special. So this is a late post. Service was good. I ordered the set for the sushi hand rolls. Each roll was made as you finished each roll. They tried to pay attention to each customer so that each roll is made fresh. It is pricier than expected with fresh made hand rolls.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Bill W.	With the toasted seaweed wraps served warm, one at a time, this place has the best sushi rolls I've tasted in town. Simple and delicious.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Warren C.	I had I high hopes for this place considering everything junya watanabe touches turns to gold but I was a bit disapointed. The food itself is quite good: everything from the rice to the nori and soy sauce was extremely high quality. The wasabi was also freshly grated and they offer an endless supply of ginger. My biggest gripe is their pricing and portion size. Each handroll was about a three biter and you can get five of those for 21 dollars. They had a two for one special that made it more affordable but honestly this is not the place to go for a satisfying lunch or dinner. I understand how high quality food comes at a price but considering the location and clientale this did not seem like a splurge worthy place. Nonetheless the food was great and if I was swimming in cash I would come here often.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jack L.	This place is awesome. Perfect date setting or a nice time with friends and family.  The rolls were fresh delicious and the beer and sake are phenomenal. Chef James is unbelievably observant and meticulous in his preparation and presentation of the rolls. The service was awesome, Hana was a great server and we always had everything we needed. Five stars! Really great experience.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Evan G.	This little concept is fire. Hand rolls, apps and incredible service. Part of the raki raki restaurant family, the food quality is exquisite. I'm not often a yelp reviewer, yet this place has the sauce. I went maine lobby, blue crab, ikura, spanish mackerel app, negi yellowtail, bay scallop, wagyu, and yellowtail sashimi. Double down on the spanish mack. It's the mackD. Ask for it if you're a foodie. It's not on the menu.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Nicky P.	Very cool place . Went for lunch and surprised it wasn't busy consider the shopping center it shares with Raki Raki is a zoo. This is a hand roll place . I got 5 hand roll deal and very good price and filling . Each handroll was a decent size . I liked all the fish they offered very fish and good. The chef is friendly and makes it right there in front of you . I'll be back .	
J Wata Temaki Bar	David H.	Pretty bad ass and unique spin on sushi.  Small hand rolls that are 4 good bites with recommended menus to get a flavor for everything.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Theodore B.	Huge fan of this place! The staff is great and the food is phenomenal. The GO [5] Temaki is my go to. 5 handrolls for just over $20, and you get lobster- can't beat it! The only downfall is parking. This lot has an abundance of great foodie spots so parking in the lot does get tight. Make sure to give yourself ample amounts of time to park and try street parking!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Cindy L.	It's the only hand roll place in town, and they don't disappoint with their fresh fish options. They have limited seats, so make sure you come early as they don't take reservations.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Cat T.	I was excited to hear about the opening of this sushi bar since I'm an avid fan of Kazunori in LA (and even the short-lived Kazunori knock-off Kiyomizu in Santa Ana).   The decor and setup of J Wata is just like Kazunori and Kiyomizu. The menu here, however, is more extensive and creative, which is both a hit and a miss. I love the idea of having more variety on the menu, but I found that the toppings and the seasoning were overdone. I could barely taste the fish in the handroll due to heavy-handed seasoning, and the fish didn't taste as fresh or flavorful as Kazunori. Furthermore, the handrolls are smaller here and more expensive. It was nice though to try different types of fish and other side dishes that aren't served at Kazunori. I do like the toasted nori here over the regular nori at Kazunori.  I don't understand their ginger and wasabi. The ginger was super salty and didn't taste good. The wasabi had zero hotness and was kind of gritty/chunky.   Based on the price, I would not eat here again unless there is a special. I would rather eat at cheaper sushi roll places. For the simplicity of a fresh handroll, I will still go to LA for Kazunori.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Thu N.	If it wasn't for the bogo deal I don't think it's worth the money. I waited for about an hr to get seating for two. It took some time to get our rolls. It would be nice if they have more chefs to tend to maybe one or two parties at a time. Average cost for a roll is about 4-7 dollars. I thought that was pretty pricey. These are not your typical hand rolls either. They are pretty small which you can finish with three bites. We each got a set with 5 rolls. We were still pretty hungry walking out. Happy lemon was such a nice treat and it is right across the street.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	M C.	Small and quaint. Excellent service and food. Love the father/son team. Perfect place for a casual date or to bring a teenage kid. I wouldn't recommend for little kids.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ana M.	Very simple ingredients with unbelievable flavors! The chef personally hands you each roll and is ready to answer any questions. The golden ratio is my favorite, would order 10 of those because they are just crazy good!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Angel N.	I AM A HUGE FAN OF HANDROLLS, and this place does an amazing job. I love the seating arrangement, a U shape bar. The staff here are all attentive and make sure you are enjoying your time there. I think its because of the limited seating that they are able to really put in the attention. The menu is done a la carte or by a set. The sets are definitely better for pricing. My bf and I both got the 5 handrolls  and we both really enjoyed each one. Make sure to eat the handroll immediately when they hand it to you so that the seaweed stays crispy. Toasted, crispy seaweed is what stands out for me when it comes to these handrolls. I adore the crab and lobster ones. If I had to pick one, crab all the way.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Lisa V.	Amazing experience! The hand roll experience is unlike anything else in San Diego. The attention to detail in each hand roll is spot on. I would recommend trying one of their set menu. My favorite is the blue crab roll (melt in your mouth worthy). Servers are very attentive and friendly. I already can't wait to come back!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Cesar V.	Had a great meal here. We selected the top tier omakase selection and were not disappointed. Top quality ingredients and the was very accommodating.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Robert G.	We had a fantastic experience fantastic meal and incredibly good service today. You have to be into these wonderful sushi rolls to make sure you're fine with a somewhat limited menu but with super high-quality products and all the components including the toasted Nori. Staff were friendly the service is excellent and this new restaurant is highly recommended.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	David S.	Excellent hand rollls.  Warm crispy seaweed wrapping cold sushi and room temp rice inside.   First few visits service was a little variable.  It is tricky because they make them right in front of you and give them right to you so they are absolutely fresh.  Last time the place was full.  And the service was excellent.  Kirin on tap.  Unique seasoning.   Unique experience.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ahren C.	SUPER nice people/ great service! GREAT food  yum yum  the sushi chefs are VERY skilled and super nice. I highly recommend the hamachi golden-ratio taro roll it has delicious yellowtail fish and the veggies in it give it a nice crunch. If you are in the mood for spice, get the spicy tuna roll! The flavors are amazing  anyways this place was the best sushi I've had in a LONG time	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Stacey R.	Great place. Not fancy but very good temaki. Hope it lasts - I'm not sure the location is right for semi-pricey 'plain' temaki. Boy is the fish fresh. And the roasted nori... We'll be back, but one does tend to keep ordering so it can get pricey. Fantastic sake too. Support it!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Melissa C.	First time here, the quality of fish is so good! Moderately priced for what it is, I'm very happy with it. It's not the greatest for when you're insanely hungry, but the taste is outta this world! The yellowtail, bluefin crab and the salmon were my favorites!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kyu S.	Checked this place out while visiting SD. The food was okay, not bad, not good, just ok. Service was amazing. Will I return? Probably not, only because I didn't walk away being wow'ed, nor do I think I'll crave it again.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ara M.	Unbelievable food! Unbelievably good flavor and the ambience couldn't be more amazing. The GO FIVE Rolls are made hand fresh right in front of your eyes. Bar none best rolls ever had in my life. Fresh ginger fresh wasabi like it was flown in 5 minutes ago!!!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Julie S.	This place is amazing. From the super talented chefs to the super friendly staff, the entire place earns its 5 stars! Come for the ambiance but stay for the food. The Spicy Tuna hand roll blew my mind and miso soup kicks some serious ass. Do your self a favor and stop by J Wata for some delicious food.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jordan T.	Of my two visits J Wata has quickly become my favorite Japanese restaurant in San Diego. When first entering you are immediately drawn to the hip murals wrapped around the walls. The menu is very simple and to the point. You can either order individual rolls or get a pre set option. I have tried the spicy salmon, unagi, spicy toro, Maine lobster, negi yellowtail, blue crab, and the negi salmon. All of them were amazing with the unagi and spicy salmon being my favorites. The unagi has a perfect amount of bbq flavor without it being an overkill. I loved the creamy texture of the spicy toro and how well the rice complements the fish. Service is awesome, they definitely aim to make everyone have a personalized experience. The chef James is very knowledgeable about the menu as well as being great to talk to! The quality and the experience you get doesn't compare to anywhere else in San Diego.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Francine P.	Love this!! FINALLY a warm sushi handroll place in San Diego. This place comes really close to Kazu Nori in Los Angeles. For a soft opening,  the service was great and food on point.  The blue crab and wagyu beef were a hit with the kids. The price was fair for the quality of ingredients. Will definitely return!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Phamhong G.	Fresh ingredients and great customer service. I've worked in over 6 sushi restaurants so I'm picky when it comes to sushi. I went during the buy 1 get 1 with the set menu so that was totally worth it! But it's really expensive for really small, thin hand rolls so I won't be coming back unless they have a promo again. :(	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Nathan C.	Pretty decent. But missing one star due to not particularly special tastes from some maki and sashimi on their menu. Their Sashimi is soaked in ponzu. Too much sauce it loses the original taste. Don't like to put good fish marinated in a cheap  sauce. Blue crab and Main lobster makis are 5 stars. All the other you can taste them at other sushi places. For that reason I give 4 Star. But blue crab and main lobster were awesome. ! Yeah I'm rather picky eater.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Connie C.	This temaki bar is a wonderful addition to Convoy St!   I'm in complete disagreement with (and annoyed by) the reviews saying the food here is bland. Good hand rolls are fresh, simplistic, and let the ingredients speak for themselves. If you want a specialty roll slathered in sauce or whatever to mask the taste of your fish, it's true that this place isn't for you... but neither is good sushi. Enjoy that crap elsewhere and stop writing bad reviews for restaurants that serve food you already know going in isn't going to be your \"thing.\"    And yes, shellfish is mixed with mayo (blue crab and lobster), and these rolls are delicious. The lobster is reminiscent of a New England lobster roll but wrapped in rice and seaweed rather than bread. Shellfish + mayo is a classic pairing. If it isn't your \"thing,\" don't order those items and stick to fish only. The more traditional fish is served as typical with rice and vinegar.  We have been here multiple times since the grand opening and the food is consistently good. Prices are very reasonable and the hand roll chefs are always friendly and fast in service. I really do hope they stick around!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tyrion T.	Chef Alex is awesome! The temaki bar creates a buzz in the dining room because it is hands on! The whole restaurant has a great energy and aesthetic. The concept is simple and perfectly executed: simple fresh ingredients and face-time with the chef. We trusted Alex to choose for us since it was our first time in and it worked out perfectly, four tasty Temaki and then one more \"premium temaki\" which was custardy uni on a fresh mint leaf. Perfect way to end a light and thoroughly satisfying meal. When we got the bill we were pleasantly surprised with the price, seems like they have options for any diner. I think they are onto something very trendy and and it must be exciting to be on the ground floor (the restaurant is about four months old). Lots of potential here, excited to see this place grow.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Samantha R.	This place should have 5 stars. Very simple and perfectly executed hand roll bar. It made me feel so relaxed just sitting there. James was our chef and very attentive and informative as well as the rest of the staff!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Gabe L.	Incredibly good temaki rolls, great quick service, super friendly staff! The food is delicious and fresh and reasonably priced. Highly recommend this place!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tiffany S.	We stumbled across this place since two other nearby locations had a wait time of over two hours. This place was amazing!!! The toasted seaweed was amazing. Everything was super high quality and staff was pleasant. Already planning on coming back with friends.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Wynn M.	I think the Raki family is trying to take over this overcrowded, terribly awful parking strip mall. This is a novel new Temaki Bar essentially perfecting sushi hand rolls. The seaweed nori is toasted and crisp for each roll. Quality of ingredients is very good so far on opening. Prices can add up quickly - e.g the lobster roll costs ~ $7.50 and can be finished in 2-3 man bites - you'll end up nibbling them to make the rolls go farther.   Most of the rolls are $5-6 or so. The set menus are a little better. Good food but don't go hungry. An upgrade from Raki - never very impressed by them but they do pack 'em in.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Angela L.	If I had to describe my dining experience in three words: artistic, fresh, and addictive.   Artistic: You're seated at the bar overlooking the masterful chefs as they prepare each roll to order. Their craft and dedication to quality work are mesmerizing- the way they wave the nori over an open flame, the way they shape the freshly cooked rice, the way they cook the indulgently fatty wagyu shabu meat, I could go on. You've got a front row seat to watch this beautiful dance.  Fresh: There's never been a more appropriate place to eat with your hands. You select your meal set (ranging from 3-5 rolls each), then the chef prepares each roll by hand before you. Your chef hands you the rolls and they encourage you to receive each roll by hand (instead of letting them place it on your plate), this way you can immediately begin eating it. From the start, they emphasized the urgency of eating the rolls immediately in order to preserve the integrity for the ingredients. Each roll uses super high quality ingredients- the fish is light and pure, the rice is warm and flavorful, and the nori is toasty and crisp. If you're anything like me, I've been taught to always wait for everyone to receive their food before eating, so it was a bit weird to start eating before my friends got their rolls, but again, you have to eat the rolls while they're fresh. And no worries, the chef keeps a watchful eye in order to control the pacing of your meal. They're mindful to provide you with some time between rolls to savor each one, that way you're never overwhelmed or rushed, while also ensuring you're never waiting too long for your next roll.   Addictive: Oh man, my friends and I joked about inquiring how much it'd cost to rent out a seat at the bar and set up permanent residence. But honestly, even before our meal set was over, we were bummed that our dining experience was coming to an end. We're definitely going to be returning soon.  The only con would be parking. It's located in the same plaza as RakiRaki and Pokkirito (same owners); parking has always been challenging in this plaza, but I'm sure with the success of this restaurant, parking will be nearly impossible. Good luck, it's worth the wait.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Connie T.	My girlfriend and I came here at lunch time around 11:30AM and it wasn't very busy which we were happy about. We had the GO combo and wagyu and it was pretty tasty. We both agreed that it was awkward AF every time one of the chefs would walk up to us and hand us a handroll. Why isn't there a small plate on the bar where the chef could place the handroll when its ready? Instead we had to do this awkward exchange with the chef/stranger 5-6 times to eat.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jake L.	Very glad there is a place like this in San Diego, no more relying on LA trips to get Kazunori. If only the parking situation was a bit better in this area, it'd be a slam dunk. Handrolls were great, and service was even better!  Looking forward to coming back.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Nazanin N.	I went for dinner with my husband and 2 other friends. The place is small and they make your order one at a time. You sit around the bar next to other people and they are standing in the middle making everyone's order. It's pretty interesting and fun. It is an actual Temaki Bar no other sits or tables. Which makes it unique	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Marissa W.	What an awesome restaurant and dining concept! Had an amazing experience here a few nights ago... great ambiance, the food was excellent, and our chef Alex was so kind and knowledgeable! Every hand roll was perfectly crafted and absolutely delicious- the prices were extremely affordable for the quality of the food. The wait staff were extremely attentive and friendly. I will definitely be dining here again!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Skull C.	Tasty but expensive for what it is. This place is basically sugar fish from Los Angeles but mostly focused on hand rolls. While tasty the prices are kind of not worth it for the food you get. We spent $50 and felt like we wanted a ramen next door. Still I might go back if I wanted a light fresh meal.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Suzan Y.	It's solid. However, I don't think it was mind blowingly good for the price that you pay. My brother definitely left still hungry, so we went to another store to grab more food.  The chef was very nice though!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Leslie C.	Happy there's a Hand Roll restaurant in San Diego! This one is definitely worth the try.  Food: I got the \"Go\" set which is the most expensive, in order of favorite to least favorite, Lobster, Scallop (and I generally dislike scallop), Spicy Tuna, Blue Crab, and Salmon. There were shells in my Blue Crab roll... bummer. I was really excited for Salmon but it was pretty bland. I wish they brushed it with some soy sauce/wasabi at least. I wish the rice was a teensy bit warmer.   Atmosphere: I think they were trying to go for a hip ambience? I didn't really care for the music.   Service: Really nice and attentive service!   I would come back: big IF... I was feeling spendy and wanted something fancy, quick, and fresh	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Karina D.	Amazing hand rolls only second to their exceptional customer service. I went on a weekday at 11:45am trying to beat the lunch rush and was surprised to find the place semi empty. If you're near the Convoy area, do not skip out on this new hand-roll bar. We were well attended and the sushi chef worked his magic to make sure each roll was delivered timely. Would absolutely recommend and can't wait to come back.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Aussie G.	This place has a neat concept and the food was fresh and delicious! We recommend trying it out.  There aren't any other places like it that we know of!  Great business model too.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	William B.	I came during the grand opening weekend with a BOGO deal (two sets for the price of one). With the BOGO deal, I do think the price is worth it. However, if I were paying the regular price, this place would be a poor value, especially considering that I wasn't full even after 5 rolls. While the concept and setting is cool, overall the quality of the ingredients is not much better than that used at Pokerrito a couple doors down (given the fact that they are owned by the same owner, I wouldn't be surprised if they used the same exact ingredients). In fact, none of the ingredients are freshly prepared; they are all scooped out of tins you would find at Chipotle and then are assembled like a burrito. At the end of the day, you're paying $22 (before tax + tip) for 5 tiny handrolls when you can walk 20 feet over to Pokerrito and experience 1 humongous handroll (aka sushi burrito) made with the same exact ingredients for less than half the price (with no tip). Or, you could go to a real sushi restaurant and pay the same price for a real sushi chef to prepare handrolls for you with better and fresher ingredients. If they lowered the price by 25% or improved the quality of their ingredients, I would consider going again but at the moment, you're certainly overpaying for what you get.  Taste: 2.5/5 Value: 1/5 Experience: 3.5/5	
J Wata Temaki Bar	NBoogie V.	This is quite the experience. It tastes delicious and it's such a nice change from all the sushi places that make crazy rolls with sub par ingredients. The hand rolls are simple yet so delicious. I would come here every day if my wallet allowed.   This place is going to get busy once people start hearing about it so go now and get it while you can. Hopefully it doesn't go down in quality once it gains popularity. And I swear if you complain about slow service maybe you shouldn't come here. The serving of the rolls is very personalized and the serving is spaced out so you can enjoy your food.   Right now they really seem to care about honing their craft and making sure everything is perfect.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tania D.	The food was ok ..... super expensive not very satisfying.. I wouldn't go back. One small roll for over $5.. service was good	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Daniella K.	One of the best bites of raw fish I've ever had. The negitoro was unbelievable. Amazing quiet date night spot.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	AnnBam W.	This place recently opened and I gotta say, the rolls were great and really fresh. You can taste the quality of the ingredients used. The staff was also attentive, coming just frequent enough to ask if we want more water or ginger. James was our chef and he was very friendly and inviting. I recommend anyone who enjoys hand rolls and sashimi to try this place out!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	William K.	Came here out of the blue with my friend because the revolving sushi place had too long of a wait. We both actually ended up liking this place much better. The experience is cool and the food tastes authentic and good!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Vivian C.	YES. Finally a hand roll sushi concept in San Diego. This place is amazing. There was no wait during the soft opening, but I'd expect crowds to flock here as people learn about this place. The negi toro and spicy salmon are my favorite.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	salvador p.	I rarely give 5 stars but this place deserves it. Simple menu, good service, incredibly fresh and  great tasting  hand rolls. The chef hands the freshly made rolls to be eaten immediately. The toasted nori adds perfect texture. Good value for the money. If there is a downside, it is the availability of parking.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	ka a.	First time at J Wata and it was delicious! The hamachi sashimi had a nice clean refreshing finish to it, and the hand rolls were perfect balance of rice to fish and so good! The chef kept a nice pace as he carefully prepared the next roll after I was done with each roll, to ensure quality and integrity of the roll. Can't wait to go back on my next SD visit!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Renee M.	Brand new Restaurant. They are all about the hand roll. Nori is like no other I have tasted and they give you one roll at a time. They want you to experience each roll as it is crispy and fresh and not soggy. The chefs are very nice and the owner came by to talk to us. He owns Raki Raki and Pokerito and is very personable and friendly. He seems to care about producing a quality product. Tried the Ikura (Salmon Roe) and was one of the freshest I have ever had. I actually judge my opinion of the Restaurant with the quality of their Ikura. My husband loved it and he is not normally a fan. Great place to try. We will return.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jeff U.	If you are looking for Japanese food, this is not the place for you.  While the food was good, it was pre-prepared seafood, meaning the seafood contents are premixed with a tasty sauce.  Not traditional by any means.  if looking for sushi, go elsewhere.  The place seemed clean and nice.  we had the spicy salmon, blue crab and lobster hand rolls.  We were expecting something freshly prepared.  They were all pre-mixed fillings.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Tawny B.	J Wata Temaki Bar is an experience of its own. It brings the intimate experience of Japanese culture cuisine to Convoy. It definitely isn't a place to go if you plan to stuff yourself but the food is definitely quality. My favorite hand rolls were the scallops and yellowtail. In addition to those I also order the wagyu which was delicious as well. Would definitely recommend this place!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Greice C.	So, I was waiting to go to this new place since they opened the restaurant. I received an email with a special invitation and then I decided to check it out. I got there at 7pm and it was alright to get two seats. We ordered and omg it took forever to start receiving the hand rolls. Our server forgot our water and we needed to keep asking for it . We ran out of soy sauce and we asked her for more, we ended up asking for the couple seating close to us if we could  have some of their soy sauce. We left the restaurant almost 9:30/10pm. The bill was pretty expensive for little hand rolls. Anyway I had the discount but guess what?!  I just realized the same server who was serving us didn't give me the discount. I was so upset that I didn't wanna come back there. In a nutshell I won't come back there. I hope you all have better experience than me.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Maureen C.	Great service, cool place and the food was good but the rolls are small.  Not a 5 star because of the size, these are more like appy size.  I did enjoy the food but I will stick with the cone hand rolls as you get twice as much for the same price.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Kendra L.	Delicious!!! Definitely our new go to date spot! The servers were friendly and attentive and everything was fresh!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ed R.	The rice and nori are good and the waitress was cute and friendly. Those are the only good points.  The hamachi hand-roll was mild, the toro was totally flavorless, the spicy salmon was not spicy but at least was decently fresh, and the blue crab was alright. But all of them were really tiny. The price seems cheap but it's really not when you factor in how extremely tiny the amount of fish in each roll is, as well as how mediocre it all was.  Even the hot tea was served in a cup that burned my hand if held for more than a second. And it just tasted like hot water, not tea.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Melissa L.	Best hand rolls I've ever had! Such incredibly nice staff and wonderful food, highly recommend.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Shigeo H.	Dinning innovation! You have to be there to sense it and taste it. You will like it for sure. guaranteed! Enjoy your Temaki! A sushi lover	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Katie K.	This place was amazing! I got the go set (includes 5 hand rolls), and the deep fried salmon cheese. I think my favorite was the salmon roll, but honestly everything was great. You can tell all the fish is really fresh too. On top of the food being great, the staff was also very friendly and attentive.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Micheal R.	Great food and great service. If your feeling experimental try the wagyu with chopped wasabi and also the Ikura with shiso they marinate it in-house. Super great food and the freshly roasted seaweed takes it over the top.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Mary K.	Let me start by saying, you need to Lyft or Uber here. Don't even try to mess with this parking situation, especially not on a weekend. Also, make a reservation, even if it's just two of you. It's all bar seating so it fills up quick. This is a small venue, in a busy complex, be prepared for a crowd. Now that all of that is out of the way, we get to the important stuff. The food. This is the best sushi I have ever had. I am not joking. This is NOT a \"California roll\" type joint. The \"rolls\" are more like non-cone hand rolls, focused on the one main ingredient. You are served them one by one, you watch the chef toast the seaweed, delicately add your main ingredient, \u0026 hand it to you (his hand to yours). You are not going to some generic \"sushi\" restaurant. You are about to have the highest quality seaweed, the best rice, the freshest most delicious fish, and everything is made in front of you. I recommend that you start with some sashimi appetizers, (the Yellowtail is my favorite). Also, the miso soup is incredible and if you order one of the prefix combos of rolls, it is included. Each person plan on get 3-5 rolls after appetizers if you're hungry \u0026 you can easily add more if you're hungry by the end. Everything is so fresh, including their wasabi \u0026 ginger. They even have I think 4 veggie rolls! Please go here, they put so much detail into making this place as great as it is. The wall art and lighting fixture above the bar, the warm staff, (SHOUT OUT TO JAMES!!!) everything about this place is incredible. Do not sleep on this. I promise you, best sushi experience in San Diego.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Christina V.	I wanted to thank Chef Brian for the great service and made our dining experience as wonderful as it could be. Server Vincent with the great smile and didn't stop me from my #sundayfunday drinking. The host, I never got your name but I know you tried your best to help me understand the concept of the restaurant. That being said, we also went for the #grandopening event BOGOF #stealdeal. Of course, we went for the baller status and got the GO set. We really enjoyed the Maine \u0026 Blue Crab Temaki. They are served with a house creamy sauce. Best Spicy Tuna I ever had and it wasn't that crazy neon red color. Here is couple #freetips: Pass on the Wagyu Shabu. It was tender but bland. End your Temaki experience with Unagi. They boil it and torch it up and it is a just prefect way to end your meal. Try the white wine. Want to know a secret menu item? If you come an hour before they close, ask for the Brian's special. They can serve you the Shabu broth that has been simmering all day with Wagyu Beef. #extraprotein. You are welcome, friends. :)	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Morley J.	We spent $50+ at this place and left so hungry we had to find another spot in Convoy to eat at.  The food is decent - fish quality is similar to what you'd find at Poke bowl places (sashimi is not cut on the spot, but stored in Tupperware containers Subway style).  The idea of being served handmade temaki rolls from a chef at a bar is a pretty cool experience,  but then again you have to wait for the chef to cook one hand roll at a time for everyone seated at the bar - not a good idea when you're hungry! Overall the portions are too small and the quality is mediocre at best.  Maybe a good appetizer spot but not if you're looking for a good meal at a good price!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Shingo H.	Went because the Kazunori in la is pretty dope. Same concept but falls short. Service was much slower than expected with subpar fish.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ally P.	I go to Kazu Nori in LA all the time (amazing) but could never find anything comparable in SD... until NOW! Best quality fish (not fishy) and just so tasty. My favorite sushi in SD hands down!!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jay X.	I timed two recent visits for a time between lunchtime and dinner to avoid crowds and it paid off, immediate seating excellent service. The food was awesome, could taste the freshness of the various fish and seafood. The hot green tea is excellent as well. The staff are professional and skilled.  The cool decor and music add to the experience.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	katia m.	4.5 great fresh fish, they bring the rolls pretty fast, the temaki are really tasty, what this place has is freshness!!!!	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Ana C.	This is probably one of my new favorite spots in Convoy. No other place can touch their customer service. Plus, they have cute modern decor which makes you feel really comfortable.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Jake T.	Fantastic experience here. Delightfully Unique. Good date spot or if you're just looking for something trendy and new. Lobster Temaki was my favorite, but everything was good.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Joseph S.	Crispy hand rolls.  Cool combos, although I went for a la carts to have the wagyu and other specialty items. Did I mention crispy hand rolls.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	John W.	Bruh I don't know why these people in here writing fake reviews. Let me be straight with you, none of the people who wrote reviews probably have never been to a real sushi place. If you want real sushi, idk just don't go here. I ordered a sushi roll expecting a WHOLE SUSHI ROLL, but instead I got a cigar sized one that I finished in two bites. They have only have one guy working the sushi bar and everyone awkwardly sits across each other waiting for their sushi to be handed to them, yes, handed to them. Not on a plate, but straight up \"here's your sushi...\" If I'm going to spend roughly $16.45 on 4 rolls, I expect quality, hand-made (as advertised), full-sized rolls. If you see anyone walk in there, it's either their first time there or they have exhausted ALL other options in ALL the restaurants in Convoy. Please save your money, spare your wallet the pain, and stay home and make your own sushi.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Justin Y.	Stumbled into this place while waiting for Ramen next door. Opened by the same chef as Rakiraki. The hand rolls were divine. The blue crab roll was our favorite. The service was exceptional and the sushi chefs were very personable.	
J Wata Temaki Bar	Amada C.	this place is so good. like REALLY good, like we ate 20 hand rolls + two plates of sashimi good. the experience is intimate and close with the chef, you can watch them prepare the orders right there as they're talking to you. the fish is soooo fresh and soft and delicious. no joke the best salmon sashimi i've ever had it wasn't fishy at all and was incredibly smooth. the hand rolls were perfect sized amounts and incredible delights of heaven into little sushi. thank you chef James for the amazing experience!!
